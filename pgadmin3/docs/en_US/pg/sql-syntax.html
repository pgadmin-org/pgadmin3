   terminates a command.  Which tokens are valid depends on the syntax
   of the particular command.
  </P

>quoted
   identifier</I

CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>literal</I

   constant), or a special character symbol.  Tokens are normally
   separated by whitespace (space, tab, newline), but need not be if
   there is no ambiguity (which is generally only the case if a
   special character is adjacent to some other token type).
  </P

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE;
UPDATE MY_TABLE SET A = 5;
INSERT INTO MY_TABLE VALUES (3, 'hi there');</PRE
><P>
    This is a sequence of three commands, one per line (although this
    is not required; more than one command can be on a line, and
    commands can usefully be split across lines).
   </P
><P
>   The SQL syntax is not very consistent regarding what tokens
   identify commands and which are operands or parameters.  The first
   few tokens are generally the command name, so in the above example

>"SELECT"</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   a <TT

   this particular variation of <TT

   requires a <TT

    key word can be letters, underscores, digits
    (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
>), or dollar signs
    (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$</TT
>).  Note that dollar signs are not allowed in identifiers
    according to the letter of the SQL standard, so their use may render
    applications less portable.
    The SQL standard will not define a key word that contains
    digits or starts or ends with an underscore, so identifiers of this
    form are safe against possible conflict with future extensions of the
    standard.

    The system uses no more than <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>NAMEDATALEN</TT

    characters of an identifier; longer names can be written in
    commands, but they will be truncated.  By default,
    <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>NAMEDATALEN</TT

    length is 63. If this limit is problematic, it can be raised by
    changing the <TT

    Identifier and key word names are case insensitive.  Therefore
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE MY_TABLE SET A = 5;</PRE
><P>
    can equivalently be written as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>uPDaTE my_TabLE SeT a = 5;</PRE
><P>
    A convention often used is to write key words in upper
    case and names in lower case, e.g.,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE my_table SET a = 5;</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P

    There is a second kind of identifier:  the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>delimited
    identifier</I
> or <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>quoted
    identifier</I
>.  It is formed by enclosing an arbitrary
    sequence of characters in double-quotes
    (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"</TT
>).  A delimited
    identifier is always an identifier, never a key word.  So
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"select"</TT
> could be used to refer to a column or
    table named <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"select"</SPAN
>, whereas an unquoted
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>select</TT
> would be taken as a key word and
    would therefore provoke a parse error when used where a table or
    column name is expected.  The example can be written with quoted
    identifiers like this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE "my_table" SET "a" = 5;</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    Quoted identifiers can contain any character other than a double
    quote itself.  (To include a double quote, write two double quotes.)
    This allows constructing table or column names that would
    otherwise not be possible, such as ones containing spaces or
    ampersands.  The length limitation still applies.
   </P
><P
>    Quoting an identifier also makes it case-sensitive, whereas
    unquoted names are always folded to lower case.  For example, the
    identifiers <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FOO</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>, and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"foo"</TT
> are considered the same by
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>, but
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Foo"</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"FOO"</TT
> are
    different from these three and each other.  (The folding of
    unquoted names to lower case in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> is
    incompatible with the SQL standard, which says that unquoted names
    should be folded to upper case.  Thus, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>
    should be equivalent to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"FOO"</TT
> not
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"foo"</TT
> according to the standard.  If you want
    to write portable applications you are advised to always quote a
    particular name or never quote it.)

     A string constant in SQL is an arbitrary sequence of characters
     bounded by single quotes (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>'This is a string'</TT

     writing a single-quote character within a string constant is to
     write two adjacent single quotes, e.g.
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>'Dianne''s horse'</TT

     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

     to be escaped with a backslash (<TT

     <TT

     byte with the corresponding code.  (It is your responsibility
     that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the
     server character set encoding.)  Any other character following a

NAME="AEN1212"
></A
><P
>     While the standard syntax for specifying string constants is usually
     convenient, it can be difficult to understand when the desired string
     contains many single quotes or backslashes, since each of those must
     be doubled. To allow more readable queries in such situations,
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> provides another way, called
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dollar quoting"</SPAN
>, to write string constants.
     A dollar-quoted string constant
     consists of a dollar sign (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$</TT
>), an optional
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"tag"</SPAN
> of zero or more characters, another dollar
     sign, an arbitrary sequence of characters that makes up the
     string content, a dollar sign, the same tag that began this
     dollar quote, and a dollar sign. For example, here are two
     different ways to specify the string <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Dianne's horse"</SPAN
>
     using dollar quoting:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>$$Dianne's horse$$
$SomeTag$Dianne's horse$SomeTag$</PRE
><P>
     Notice that inside the dollar-quoted string, single quotes can be
     used without needing to be escaped.  Indeed, no characters inside
     a dollar-quoted string are ever escaped: the string content is always
     written literally.  Backslashes are not special, and neither are
     dollar signs, unless they are part of a sequence matching the opening
     tag.
    </P
><P
>     It is possible to nest dollar-quoted string constants by choosing
     different tags at each nesting level.  This is most commonly used in
     writing function definitions.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>$function$
BEGIN
    RETURN ($1 ~ $q$[\t\r\n\v\\]$q$);
END;
$function$</PRE
><P>
     Here, the sequence <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$q$[\t\r\n\v\\]$q$</TT
> represents a
     dollar-quoted literal string <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>[\t\r\n\v\\]</TT
>, which will
     be recognized when the function body is executed by
     <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.  But since the sequence does not match
     the outer dollar quoting delimiter <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$function$</TT
>, it is
     just some more characters within the constant so far as the outer
     string is concerned.
    </P
><P
>     The tag, if any, of a dollar-quoted string follows the same rules
     as an unquoted identifier, except that it cannot contain a dollar sign.
     Tags are case sensitive, so <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$tag$String content$tag$</TT
>
     is correct, but <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$TAG$String content$tag$</TT
> is not.
    </P
><P
>     A dollar-quoted string that follows a keyword or identifier must
     be separated from it by whitespace; otherwise the dollar quoting
     delimiter would be taken as part of the preceding identifier.
    </P
><P
>     Dollar quoting is not part of the SQL standard, but it is often a more
     convenient way to write complicated string literals than the
     standard-compliant single quote syntax.  It is particularly useful when
     representing string constants inside other constants, as is often needed
     in procedural function definitions.  With single-quote syntax, each
     backslash in the above example would have to be written as four
     backslashes, which would be reduced to two backslashes in parsing the
     original string constant, and then to one when the inner string constant
     is re-parsed during function execution.

    Most operators have the same precedence and are left-associative.
    The precedence and associativity of the operators is hard-wired
    into the parser.  This may lead to non-intuitive behavior; for
    example the Boolean operators <TT

    sometimes need to add parentheses when using combinations of
    binary and unary operators.  For instance
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT 5 ! - 6;</PRE
><P>
   will be parsed as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT 5 ! (- 6);</PRE
><P>
    because the parser has no idea &mdash; until it is too late
    &mdash; that <TT
CLASS="TOKEN"
>!</TT
> is defined as a postfix operator,
    not an infix one.  To get the desired behavior in this case, you
    must write
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT (5 !) - 6;</PRE
><P>
    This is the price one pays for extensibility.
