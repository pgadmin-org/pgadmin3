   for each data type it works on.
   It might be useful for a complex-number data type
   to have one B-tree operator class that sorts the data by complex
   absolute value, another that sorts by real part, and so on.
   Typically, one of the operator classes will be deemed most commonly
   useful and will be marked as the default operator class for that
   data type and index method.

   and hash index methods have operator classes named

   entity and must be defined separately.

NAME="XINDEX-EXAMPLE"
>31.14.4. An Example</A
></H2
><P
>   Now that we have seen the ideas, here is the promised example of
   creating a new operator class.
   (You can find a working copy of this example in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/tutorial/complex.c</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/tutorial/complex.sql</TT
> in the source
   distribution.)
   The operator class encapsulates
   operators that sort complex numbers in absolute value order, so we
   choose the name <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>complex_abs_ops</TT
>.  First, we need
   a set of operators.  The procedure for defining operators was
   discussed in <A
HREF="xoper.html"
>Section 31.12</A
>.  For an operator class on
   B-trees, the operators we require are:

   <P
></P
></P><UL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value less-than (strategy 1)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value less-than-or-equal (strategy 2)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value equal (strategy 3)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value greater-than-or-equal (strategy 4)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value greater-than (strategy 5)</SPAN
></LI
></UL
><P>
  </P
><P
>   The least error-prone way to define a related set of comparison operators
   is to write the B-tree comparison support function first, and then write the
   other functions as one-line wrappers around the support function.  This
   reduces the odds of getting inconsistent results for corner cases.
   Following this approach, we first write

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#define Mag(c)  ((c)-&gt;x*(c)-&gt;x + (c)-&gt;y*(c)-&gt;y)

static int
complex_abs_cmp_internal(Complex *a, Complex *b)
{
    double      amag = Mag(a),
                bmag = Mag(b);

    if (amag &lt; bmag)
        return -1;
    if (amag &gt; bmag)
        return 1;
    return 0;
}</PRE
><P>

   Now the less-than function looks like

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_abs_lt);

Datum
complex_abs_lt(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *a = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    Complex    *b = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(1);

    PG_RETURN_BOOL(complex_abs_cmp_internal(a, b) &lt; 0);
}</PRE
><P>

   The other four functions differ only in how they compare the internal
   function's result to zero.
  </P
><P
>   Next we declare the functions and the operators based on the functions
   to SQL:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION complex_abs_lt(complex, complex) RETURNS bool
    AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>', 'complex_abs_lt'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE OPERATOR &lt; (
   leftarg = complex, rightarg = complex, procedure = complex_abs_lt,
   commutator = &gt; , negator = &gt;= ,
   restrict = scalarltsel, join = scalarltjoinsel
);</PRE
><P>
   It is important to specify the correct commutator and negator operators,
   as well as suitable restriction and join selectivity
   functions, otherwise the optimizer will be unable to make effective
   use of the index.  Note that the less-than, equal, and
   greater-than cases should use different selectivity functions.
  </P
><P
>   Other things worth noting are happening here:

  <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>     There can only be one operator named, say, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
>
     and taking type <TT

     case we don't have any other operator <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> for
     <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>complex</TT
>, but if we were building a practical data
     type we'd probably want <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>=</TT
> to be the ordinary
     equality operation for complex numbers (and not the equality of
     the absolute values).  In that case, we'd need to use some other
     operator name for <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>complex_abs_eq</CODE
>.

     functions having the same name as long as they have different

     something simple like <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>abs_eq</TT

     a good practice to include the data type name in the C function
     name, so as not to conflict with functions for other data types.

     level.
    </P
></LI
></UL
><P>
  </P
><P
>   The next step is the registration of the support routine required
   by B-trees.  The example C code that implements this is in the same
   file that contains the operator functions.  This is how we declare
   the function:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Now that we have the required operators and support routine,
   we can finally create the operator class:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE OPERATOR CLASS complex_abs_ops
    DEFAULT FOR TYPE complex USING btree AS
        OPERATOR        1       &lt; ,

        OPERATOR        5       &gt; ,
        FUNCTION        1       complex_abs_cmp(complex, complex);</PRE
><P>
  </P

   Notice that this definition <SPAN

   support function numbers.  This is allowed (for B-tree operator classes
   only) so long as each instance of a particular number has a different
   right-hand data type.  The instances that are not cross-type are the
   default or primary operators of the operator class.
  </P
><P
>   GiST indexes do not allow overloading of strategy or support function
   numbers, but it is still possible to get the effect of supporting
   multiple right-hand data types, by assigning a distinct strategy number
   to each operator that needs to be supported.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>consistent</TT

   support function must determine what it needs to do based on the strategy
   number, and must be prepared to accept comparison values of the appropriate
   data types.

><P
>   There are two special features of operator classes that we have
   not discussed yet, mainly because they are not useful
   with the most commonly used index methods.
  </P
><P
>   Normally, declaring an operator as a member of an operator class means
   that the index method can retrieve exactly the set of rows
   that satisfy a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition using the operator.  For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM table WHERE integer_column &lt; 4;</PRE
><P>
   can be satisfied exactly by a B-tree index on the integer column.
   But there are cases where an index is useful as an inexact guide to
   the matching rows.  For example, if an R-tree index stores only
   bounding boxes for objects, then it cannot exactly satisfy a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
   condition that tests overlap between nonrectangular objects such as
   polygons.  Yet we could use the index to find objects whose bounding
   box overlaps the bounding box of the target object, and then do the
   exact overlap test only on the objects found by the index.  If this
   scenario applies, the index is said to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lossy"</SPAN
> for the
   operator, and we add <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECHECK</TT
> to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OPERATOR</TT
> clause
   in the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE OPERATOR CLASS</TT
> command.
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECHECK</TT
> is valid if the index is guaranteed to return
   all the required rows, plus perhaps some additional rows, which
   can be eliminated by performing the original operator invocation.
  </P
><P
>   Consider again the situation where we are storing in the index only
   the bounding box of a complex object such as a polygon.  In this
   case there's not much value in storing the whole polygon in the index
   entry &mdash; we may as well store just a simpler object of type
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>box</TT
>.  This situation is expressed by the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STORAGE</TT
>
   option in <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE OPERATOR CLASS</TT
>: we'd write something like

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE OPERATOR CLASS polygon_ops
    DEFAULT FOR TYPE polygon USING gist AS
        ...
        STORAGE box;</PRE
><P>

   At present, only the GiST index method supports a
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STORAGE</TT
> type that's different from the column data type.
   The GiST <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>compress</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>decompress</TT
> support
   routines must deal with data-type conversion when <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STORAGE</TT
>
   is used.
