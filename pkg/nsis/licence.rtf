\par Preamble
\par 
\par The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right t
o use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
\par 
\par Definitions:
\par 
\par "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. 
\par 
\par "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. 
\par 
\par "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 
\par 
\par "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 
\par 
\par "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
\par 
\par "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
\par 
\par 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
\par 
\par 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
\par 
\par b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
\par 
\par c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how 
it differs from the Standard Version.
\par 
\par d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
