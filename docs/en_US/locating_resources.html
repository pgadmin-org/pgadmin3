<h3>Locating Resources</h3>

<p>
pgAdmin3 will load all *.xrc files from the ui/common directory first, 
then from the ui/win32 or ui/gtk directory. If a resource is present in 
both directories, the platform specific version will win (that's how the 
wxWindows implementation works now, to avoid future trouble a resource 
should be present in one directory only).
</p>

<p>
On Win32, the standard location for the ui directory is relative to the 
pgAdmin3.exe binary (aka loadPath) e.g:<br><br>
c:\program files\pgAdmin3\pgAdmin3.exe<br>
c:\program files\pgAdmin3\ui\common\*.xrc<br>
c:\program files\pgAdmin3\ui\win32\*.xrc<br>
</p>

<p>
On Linux, the location is determined by configure values; usually they 
go to /usr/local/pgadmin3 (currently, they go to 
user/local/pgadmin3/shared/pgadmin3, we should fix this unnecessary long 
paths), so standard is /usr/local/pgadmin3/ui/common and 
/usr/local/pgadmin3/ui/gtk.
</p>

<p>
To make developer's life easier (i.e. debugging without installing), for 
both systems there are alternative directory locations.
On Win32, if no resource is found under loadPath/ui/common, files are 
loaded from loadPath/../ui/common; same is done for ui/win32. This is to 
reflect the project directory layout that the VC IDE creates, which will 
put the pgAdmin3.exe in the ./Debug or ./Release directory, so ./ui is 
under ../ui relative to the pgAdmin3.exe.
</p>

<p>
On Linux, similar things happen. If $(datadir)/ui/common contains no xrc 
files loadPath/ui/common is used instead. Same is performed for ui/gtk. 
Here, the freshly compiled pgAdmin3 will reside in the same directory as ui.
</p>

<p>
If necessary, we might restrict the alternate load location with a 
command line option.
</p>

<p>
Note that on Windows the directory defined by configure is replaced with
'./'. This is also prepended to the path to tips.txt.
