     not protect against attacks while the filesystem is mounted,
     because when mounted, the operating system provides an unencrypted
     view of the data. However, to mount the filesystem, you need some
     way for the encryption key to be passed to the operating system,
     and sometimes the key is stored somewhere on the host that mounts
     the disk.

     It is possible for both the client and server to provide SSL keys
     or certificates to each other. It takes some extra configuration
     on each side, but this provides stronger verification of identity
     than the mere use of passwords. It prevents a computer from
     pretending to be the server just long enough to read the password
     send by the client. It also helps prevent "man in the middle"
     attacks where a computer between the client and server pretends to
     be the server and reads and passes all data between the client and
     server.

     to be decrypted on the client before being used.
