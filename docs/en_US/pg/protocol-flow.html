   There are several different sub-protocols
   depending on the state of the connection: start-up,
   query, function call, COPY, and termination.  There are also special
   provisions for asynchronous operations (including
   notification responses and command cancellation),
   which can occur at any time after the start-up phase.

></H2
><P
>    To begin a session, a frontend opens a connection to the server and sends
    a startup message.  This message includes the names of the user and of the
    database the user wants to connect to; it also identifies the particular
    protocol version to be used.  (Optionally, the startup message can include
    additional settings for run-time parameters.)
    The server then uses this information and
    the contents of its configuration files (such as
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
>) to determine
    whether the connection is provisionally acceptable, and what additional
    authentication is required (if any).
   </P
><P
>    The server then sends an appropriate authentication request message,
    to which the frontend must reply with an appropriate authentication
    response message (such as a password).
    In principle the authentication request/response cycle could require
    multiple iterations, but none of the present authentication methods
    use more than one request and response.  In some methods, no response
    at all is needed from the frontend, and so no authentication request
    occurs.

></H2
><P
>    During the processing of a query, the frontend may request
    cancellation of the query.  The cancel request is not sent
    directly on the open connection to the backend for reasons of
    implementation efficiency: we don't want to have the backend
    constantly checking for new input from the frontend during query
    processing.  Cancel requests should be relatively infrequent, so
    we make them slightly cumbersome in order to avoid a penalty in
    the normal case.
   </P
><P
>    To issue a cancel request, the frontend opens a new connection to
    the server and sends a CancelRequest message, rather than the
    StartupMessage message that would ordinarily be sent across a new
    connection.  The server will process this request and then close
    the connection.  For security reasons, no direct reply is made to
    the cancel request message.
   </P
><P
>    A CancelRequest message will be ignored unless it contains the
    same key data (PID and secret key) passed to the frontend during
    connection start-up.  If the request matches the PID and secret
    key for a currently executing backend, the processing of the
    current query is aborted.  (In the existing implementation, this is
    done by sending a special signal to the backend process that is
    processing the query.)
   </P
><P
>    The cancellation signal may or may not have any effect --- for
    example, if it arrives after the backend has finished processing
    the query, then it will have no effect.  If the cancellation is
    effective, it results in the current command being terminated
    early with an error message.
   </P
><P
>    The upshot of all this is that for reasons of both security and
    efficiency, the frontend has no direct way to tell whether a
    cancel request has succeeded.  It must continue to wait for the
    backend to respond to the query.  Issuing a cancel simply improves
    the odds that the current query will finish soon, and improves the
    odds that it will fail with an error message instead of
    succeeding.
   </P
><P
>    Since the cancel request is sent across a new connection to the
    server and not across the regular frontend/backend communication
    link, it is possible for the cancel request to be issued by any
    process, not just the frontend whose query is to be canceled.
    This may have some benefits of flexibility in building
    multiple-process applications.  It also introduces a security
    risk, in that unauthorized persons might try to cancel queries.
    The security risk is addressed by requiring a dynamically
    generated secret key to be supplied in cancel requests.

    dump at one end or the other, loss of the communications link, loss of
    message-boundary synchronization, etc.  If either frontend or backend sees
    an unexpected closure of the connection, it should clean
    up and terminate.  The frontend has the option of launching a new backend
    by recontacting the server if it doesn't want to terminate itself.
    Closing the connection is also advisable if an unrecognizable message type
    is received, since this probably indicates loss of message-boundary sync.
