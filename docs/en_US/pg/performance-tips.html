    You can use the

    Plan-reading is an art that deserves an extensive tutorial, which
    this is not; but here is some basic information.
   </P

>    The structure of a query plan is a tree of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

    Nodes at the bottom level are table scan nodes: they return raw rows
    from a table.  There are different types of scan nodes for different
    table access methods: sequential scans, index scans, and bitmap index
    scans.  If the query requires joining, aggregation, sorting, or other
    operations on the raw rows, then there will be additional nodes
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"atop"</SPAN
> the scan nodes to perform these operations.  Again,
    there is usually more than one possible way to do these operations,
    so different node types can appear here too.  The output
    of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> has one line for each node in the plan
    tree, showing the basic node type plus the cost estimates that the planner
    made for the execution of that plan node.  The first line (topmost node)
    has the estimated total execution cost for the plan; it is this number
    that the planner seeks to minimize.

    the cost of all its child nodes.  It's also important to realize that
    the cost only reflects things that the planner cares about.
    In particular, the cost does not consider the time spent transmitting
    result rows to the client, which could be an important
    factor in the true elapsed time; but the planner ignores it because
    it cannot change it by altering the plan.  (Every correct plan will
    output the same row set, we trust.)

    conditions that are being 
    applied at the node.  Ideally the top-level rows estimate will
    approximate the number of rows actually returned, updated, or deleted

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1;

                         QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

><P>

    you will find out that <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk1</CODE
> has 358 disk
    pages and 10000 rows.  So the cost is estimated at 358 page
    reads, defined as costing 1.0 apiece, plus 10000 * <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-TUPLE-COST"
>cpu_tuple_cost</A
> which is
    typically 0.01 (try <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SHOW cpu_tuple_cost</TT
>).
   </P
><P
>    Now let's modify the query to add a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 7000;

                         QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..483.00 rows=7033 width=244)
   Filter: (unique1 &lt; 7000)</PRE
><P>

    Notice that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> output shows the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
    clause being applied as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"filter"</SPAN
> condition; this means that
    the plan node checks the condition for each row it scans, and outputs
    only the ones that pass the condition.
    The estimate of output rows has gone down because of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
    clause.
    However, the scan will still have to visit all 10000 rows, so the cost
    hasn't decreased; in fact it has gone up a bit to reflect the extra CPU
    time spent checking the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition.
   </P
><P
>    The actual number of rows this query would select is 7000, but the rows
    estimate is only approximate.  If you try to duplicate this experiment,
    you will probably get a slightly different estimate; moreover, it will
    change after each <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> command, because the
    statistics produced by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT

    randomized sample of the table.
   </P
><P
>    Now, let's make the condition more restrictive:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&#62;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
         Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)</PRE
><P>

    Here the planner has decided to use a two-step plan: the bottom plan
    node visits an index to find the locations of rows matching the index
    condition, and then the upper plan node actually fetches those rows
    from the table itself.  Fetching the rows separately is much more
    expensive than sequentially reading them, but because not all the pages
    of the table have to be visited, this is still cheaper than a sequential
    scan.  (The reason for using two levels of plan is that the upper plan
    node sorts the row locations identified by the index into physical order
    before reading them, so as to minimize the costs of the separate fetches.
    The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bitmap"</SPAN
> mentioned in the node names is the mechanism that
    does the sorting.)
   </P
><P
>    If the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition is selective enough, the planner may
    switch to a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"simple"</SPAN
> index scan plan:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.00 rows=2 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)</PRE
><P>

    In this case the table rows are fetched in index order, which makes them
    even more expensive to read, but there are so few that the extra cost
    of sorting the row locations is not worth it.  You'll most often see
    this plan type for queries that fetch just a single row, and for queries
    that request an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> condition that matches the index
    order.
   </P
><P
>    Add another condition to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3 AND stringu1 = 'xxx';

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.01 rows=1 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)
   Filter: (stringu1 = 'xxx'::name)</PRE
><P>

    The added condition <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1 = 'xxx'</TT
> reduces the
    output-rows estimate, but not the cost because we still have to visit the
    same set of rows.  Notice that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1</TT
> clause
    cannot be applied as an index condition (since this index is only on
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1</TT
> column).  Instead it is applied as a filter on
    the rows retrieved by the index.  Thus the cost has actually gone up
    a little bit to reflect this extra checking.
   </P
><P
>    If there are indexes on several columns used in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>, the
    planner might choose to use an AND or OR combination of the indexes:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100 AND unique2 &gt; 9000;

                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=11.27..49.11 rows=11 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: ((unique1 &lt; 100) AND (unique2 &gt; 9000))
   -&gt;  BitmapAnd  (cost=11.27..11.27 rows=11 width=0)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique2  (cost=0.00..8.65 rows=1042 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique2 &gt; 9000)</PRE
><P>

    But this requires visiting both indexes, so it's not necessarily a win
    compared to using just one index and treating the other condition as
    a filter.  If you vary the ranges involved you'll see the plan change
    accordingly.
   </P
><P
>    Let's try joining two tables, using the columns we have been discussing:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2 WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                      QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=2.37..553.11 rows=106 width=488)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
         Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using tenk2_unique2 on tenk2 t2  (cost=0.00..3.01 rows=1 width=244)
         Index Cond: ("outer".unique2 = t2.unique2)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    In this nested-loop join, the outer scan is the same bitmap index scan we
    saw earlier, and so its cost and row count are the same because we are
    applying the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1 &lt; 100</TT
>
    at that node.
    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</TT
> clause is not relevant yet,
    so it doesn't affect row count of the outer scan.  For the inner scan, the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique2</TT
> value of the current outer-scan row is plugged into
    the inner index scan to produce an index condition like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t2.unique2 = <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>constant</I
></TT
></TT
>.
    So we get the same inner-scan plan and costs that we'd get from, say,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk2 WHERE unique2 = 42</TT
>.  The
    costs of the loop node are then set on the basis of the cost of the outer
    scan, plus one repetition of the inner scan for each outer row (106 * 3.01,
    here), plus a little CPU time for join processing.
   </P
><P
>    In this example the join's output row count is the same as the product
    of the two scans' row counts, but that's not true in general, because
    in general you can have <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clauses that mention both tables
    and so can only be applied at the join point, not to either input scan.
    For example, if we added
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE ... AND t1.hundred &lt; t2.hundred</TT
>,
    that would decrease the output row count of the join node, but not change
    either input scan.
   </P
><P

>    In some query plans, it is possible for a subplan node to be executed more
    than once.  For example, the inner index scan is executed once per outer
    row in the above nested-loop plan.  In such cases, the
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loops"</SPAN
> value reports the
    total number of executions of the node, and the actual time and rows
    values shown are averages per-execution.  This is done to make the numbers
    comparable with the way that the cost estimates are shown.  Multiply by
    the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loops"</SPAN

    the node.

    may be considerably larger, because it includes the time spent processing

    essentially is the time spent computing the new rows and/or locating the
    old ones, but it doesn't include the time spent making the changes.
    Time spent firing triggers, if any, is also outside the top plan node,
    and is shown separately for each trigger.

    The planner's cost estimates are not linear and so it may well choose
    a different plan for a larger or smaller table.  An extreme example
    is that on a table that only occupies one disk page, you'll nearly
    always get a sequential scan plan whether indexes are available or not.
    The planner realizes that it's going to take one disk page read to
    process the table in any case, so there's no value in expending additional
    page reads to look at an index.

      You should be able to get similar results if you try the examples yourself,
      but your estimated costs and row counts will probably vary slightly
      because <TT
