NAME="POSTMASTER-START"
>16.3. Starting the Database Server</A
></H1
><P
>   Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database
   server. The database server program is called
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postmaster</TT
>.<A
NAME="AEN15922"
></A
>
   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postmaster</TT
> must know where to
   find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the
   <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the
   server is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be
   done while logged into the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user
   account. Without <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
>, the server will try to use
   the data directory named by the environment variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGDATA</TT
>.
   If that variable is not provided either, it will fail.
  </P
><P
>   Normally it is better to start the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postmaster</TT
> in the
   background.  For this, use the usual shell syntax:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   It is important to store the server's <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>stdout</SPAN
> and
   <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>stderr</SPAN
> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help
   for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <A
HREF="logfile-maintenance.html"
>Section 21.3</A
> for a more thorough discussion of log
   file handling.)
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postmaster</TT
> also takes a number of other
   command line options. For more information, see the reference page
   and <A
HREF="runtime-config.html"
>Section 16.4</A
> below.
  </P
><P
>   This shell syntax can get tedious quickly.  Therefore the shell
   script wrapper
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pg_ctl</TT
><A
NAME="AEN15943"
></A
>
   is provided to simplify some tasks.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>pg_ctl start -l logfile</PRE
><P>
   will start the server in the background and put the output into the
   named log file. The <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
> option has the same meaning
   here as in the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postmaster</TT
>. <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pg_ctl</TT
> is also
   capable of stopping the server.
  </P
><P
>   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots.<A
NAME="AEN15950"
></A
> Autostart scripts are operating-system-specific.
   There are a few distributed with
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> in the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib/start-scripts</TT
> directory. Installing one will require
   root privileges.
  </P
><P
>   Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons
   at boot time. Many systems have a file
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc.local</TT
> or
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</TT
>. Others use
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rc.d</TT
> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be
   run by the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user account
   <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and not by root</I
></SPAN
> or any other user. Therefore you
   probably should form your commands using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>su -c '...'
   postgres</TT
>.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>su -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog' postgres</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P

     This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start
     another <TT

     However, if the kernel error message is not <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Address

> or some variant of that, there may
     be a different problem. For example, trying to start a <TT

     on a reserved port number may draw something like:
</P><PRE

     probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is
     smaller than the work area <SPAN

     is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you
     can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number
     of buffers (<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-B</TT

     to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory
     size. You may also see this message when trying to start multiple
     servers on the same machine, if their total space requested
     exceeds the kernel limit.

     increase the kernel limit.
    </P
