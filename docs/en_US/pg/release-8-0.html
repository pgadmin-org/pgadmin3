        a server. It can run as a <SPAN

        without affecting the remainder of the transaction. Prior
        releases had no such capability; there was no way to recover
        from a statement failure within a transaction except by
        aborting the whole transaction. This feature is valuable for
        application writers who require error recovery within a
        complex transaction.

        drive failure except to restore from a previous backup or use
        a standby replication server.  Point-in-time recovery allows
        continuous backup of the server.  You can recover either to
        the point of failure or to some transaction in the past.

        usage. Prior releases used <SPAN

>        New buffer replacement strategy that improves caching (Jan)
       </P
><P
>        Prior releases used a least-recently-used (LRU) cache to keep
        recently referenced pages in memory. The LRU algorithm
        did not consider the number of times a specific cache entry was
        accessed, so large table scans could force out useful cache pages.
        The new cache algorithm uses four separate lists to track most
        recently used and most frequently used cache pages and dynamically 
        optimize their replacement based on the work load. This should
        lead to much more efficient use of the shared buffer cache.
        Administrators who have tested shared buffer sizes in the past
        should retest with this new cache replacement policy.

><P
>        Add subprocess to write dirty buffers periodically to reduce
        checkpoint writes (Jan)
       </P
><P
>        In previous releases, the checkpoint process, which runs every few
        minutes, would write all dirty buffers to the operating system's
        buffer cache then flush all dirty operating system buffers to
        disk. This resulted in a periodic spike in disk usage that often
        hurt performance. The new code uses a background writer to trickle
        disk writes at a steady pace so checkpoints have far fewer dirty
        pages to write to disk. Also, the new code does not issue a global
        <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sync()</CODE
> call, but instead <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>fsync()</CODE
>s just
        the files written since the last checkpoint. This should improve
