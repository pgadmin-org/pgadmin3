bit-string-category inputs.  Since string category is preferred when available,
that category is selected, and then the 
preferred type for strings, <TT

>The <SPAN

entries for the prefix operator <VAR

absolute-value operations for various numeric data types.  One of these

the numeric category.  Therefore, <SPAN

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

Here the system has performed an implicit conversion from <TT

before applying the chosen operator.  We can verify that <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

not some other type was used:

>On the other hand, the postfix operator <VAR

try a similar case with <VAR

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT '20' ! AS "factorial";

ERROR:  operator is not unique: "unknown" !
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You may need to add explicit
type casts.</PRE
><P>
This happens because the system can't decide which of the several
possible <VAR

it out with an explicit cast:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
