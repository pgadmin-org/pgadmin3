<a name="id514108"></a><a name="id514123"></a><p>    The first test to see whether you can access the database server
    is to try to create a database.  A running
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server can manage many
    databases.  Typically, a separate database is used for each
    project or for each user.
   </p>
<p>    Possibly, your site administrator has already created a database
    for your use.  He should have told you what the name of your
    database is.  In that case you can omit this step and skip ahead
    to the next section.
   </p>
<p>    To create a new database, in this example named
    <code class="literal">mydb</code>, you use the following command:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>createdb mydb</code></strong></pre>
<p>
    This should produce as response:
</p>
<pre class="screen">CREATE DATABASE</pre>
<p>
    If so, this step was successful and you can skip over the
    remainder of this section.
   </p>
<p>    If you see a message similar to
</p>
<pre class="screen">createdb: command not found</pre>
<p>
    then <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> was not installed properly.  Either it was not
    installed at all or the search path was not set correctly.  Try
    calling the command with an absolute path instead:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb mydb</code></strong></pre>
<p>
    The path at your site might be different.  Contact your site
    administrator or check back in the installation instructions to
    correct the situation.
   </p>
<p>    Another response could be this:
</p>
<pre class="screen">createdb: could not connect to database template1: could not connect to server:
No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?</pre>
<p>
    This means that the server was not started, or it was not started
    where <code class="command">createdb</code> expected it.  Again, check the
    installation instructions or consult the administrator.
   </p>
<p>    Another response could be this:
</p>
<pre class="screen">createdb: could not connect to database template1: FATAL:  user "joe" does not
exist</pre>
<p>
    where your own login name is mentioned.  This will happen if the
    administrator has not created a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user account
    for you.  (<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user accounts are distinct from
    operating system user accounts.)  If you are the administrator, see
    <a href="user-manag.html" title="Chapter 17. Database Users and Privileges">Chapter 17, <i>Database Users and Privileges</i></a> for help creating accounts.  You will need to
    become the operating system user under which <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    was installed (usually <code class="literal">postgres</code>) to create the first user
    account.  It could also be that you were assigned a
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user name that is different from your
    operating system user name; in that case you need to use the <code class="option">-U</code>
    switch or set the <code class="envar">PGUSER</code> environment variable to specify your
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user name.
   </p>
<p>    If you have a user account but it does not have the privileges required to
    create a database, you will see the following:
</p>
<pre class="screen">createdb: database creation failed: ERROR:  permission denied to create database</pre>
<p>
    Not every user has authorization to create new databases.  If
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> refuses to create databases
    for you then the site administrator needs to grant you permission
    to create databases.  Consult your site administrator if this
    occurs.  If you installed <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    yourself then you should log in for the purposes of this tutorial
    under the user account that you started the server as.

    <sup>[<a name="id514360" href="#ftn.id514360">1</a>]</sup>
   </p>
<p>    You can also create databases with other names.
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> allows you to create any
    number of databases at a given site.  Database names must have an
    alphabetic first character and are limited to 63 characters in
    length.  A convenient choice is to create a database with the same
    name as your current user name.  Many tools assume that database
    name as the default, so it can save you some typing.  To create
    that database, simply type
</p>
<pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>createdb</code></strong></pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    If you do not want to use your database anymore you can remove it.
    For example, if you are the owner (creator) of the database
    <code class="literal">mydb</code>, you can destroy it using the following
    command:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>dropdb mydb</code></strong></pre>
<p>
    (For this command, the database name does not default to the user
    account name.  You always need to specify it.)  This action
    physically removes all files associated with the database and
    cannot be undone, so this should only be done with a great deal of
    forethought.
   </p>
<p>    More about <code class="command">createdb</code> and <code class="command">dropdb</code> may
    be found in <a href="app-createdb.html" title="createdb"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-createdb-title"></a><span class="application">createdb</span></span></a> and <a href="app-dropdb.html" title="dropdb"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-dropdb-title"></a><span class="application">dropdb</span></span></a>
    respectively.

<div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id514360" href="#id514360">1</a>] </sup>      As an explanation for why this works:
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user names are separate
      from operating system user accounts.  If you connect to a
      database, you can choose what
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user name to connect as;
      if you don't, it will default to the same name as your current
      operating system account.  As it happens, there will always be a
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user account that has the
      same name as the operating system user that started the server,
      and it also happens that that user always has permission to
      create databases.  Instead of logging in as that user you can
      also specify the <code class="option">-U</code> option everywhere to select
      a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> user name to connect as.
