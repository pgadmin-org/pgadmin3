><P
>    The first test to see whether you can access the database server
    is to try to create a database.  A running
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server can manage many
    databases.  Typically, a separate database is used for each
    project or for each user.
   </P
><P
>    Possibly, your site administrator has already created a database
    for your use.  He should have told you what the name of your
    database is.  In this case you can omit this step and skip ahead
    to the next section.
   </P
><P
>    To create a new database, in this example named
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mydb</VAR
>, you use the following command:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>$</SAMP
> <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>createdb mydb</KBD
></PRE
><P>
    This should produce as response:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>CREATE DATABASE</PRE
><P>
    If so, this step was successful and you can skip over the
    remainder of this section.
   </P
><P
>    If you see a message similar to
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>createdb: command not found</PRE
><P>
    then <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> was not installed properly.  Either it was not
    installed at all or the search path was not set correctly.  Try
    calling the command with an absolute path instead:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>$</SAMP
> <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb mydb</KBD
></PRE
><P>
    The path at your site might be different.  Contact your site
    administrator or check back in the installation instructions to
    correct the situation.
   </P
><P
>    Another response could be this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
createdb: database creation failed</PRE
><P>
    This means that the server was not started, or it was not started
    where <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>createdb</TT
> expected it.  Again, check the
    installation instructions or consult the administrator.
   </P
><P
>    If you do not have the privileges required to create a database,
    you will see the following:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ERROR:  CREATE DATABASE: permission denied
createdb: database creation failed</PRE
><P>
    Not every user has authorization to create new databases.  If
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> refuses to create databases
    for you then the site administrator needs to grant you permission
    to create databases.  Consult your site administrator if this
    occurs.  If you installed <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    yourself then you should log in for the purposes of this tutorial
    under the user account that you started the server as.

   </P

>    You can also create databases with other names.
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> allows you to create any
    number of databases at a given site.  Database names must have an
    alphabetic first character and are limited to 63 characters in
    length.  A convenient choice is to create a database with the same
    name as your current user name.  Many tools assume that database
    name as the default, so it can save you some typing.  To create
    that database, simply type
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>$</SAMP
> <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>createdb</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    If you do not want to use your database anymore you can remove it.
    For example, if you are the owner (creator) of the database
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mydb</VAR
>, you can destroy it using the following
    command:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>$</SAMP
> <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>dropdb mydb</KBD
></PRE
><P>
    (For this command, the database name does not default to the user
    account name.  You always need to specify it.)  This action
    physically removes all files associated with the database and
    cannot be undone, so this should only be done with a great deal of
    forethought.

>      As an explanation for why this works:
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user names are separate
      from operating system user accounts.  If you connect to a
      database, you can choose what
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user name to connect as;
      if you don't, it will default to the same name as your current
      operating system account.  As it happens, there will always be a
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user account that has the
      same name as the operating system user that started the server,
      and it also happens that that user always has permission to
      create databases.  Instead of logging in as that user you can
      also specify the <VAR
CLASS="OPTION"
>-U</VAR
> option everywhere to select
      a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user name to connect as.
