    in mind.
    In the following, <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>update rules</I
> means rules that are defined
    on <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT

><P
>    Update rules get applied by the rule system when the result
    relation and the command type of a query tree are equal to the
    object and event given in the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE RULE</TT
> command.
    For update rules, the rule system creates a list of query trees.
    Initially the query-tree list is empty.
    There can be zero (<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NOTHING</VAR
> key word), one, or multiple actions.
    To simplify, we will look at a rule with one action. This rule
    can have a qualification or not and it can be <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
> or not.</P
><P
>    What is a rule qualification? It is a restriction that tells
    when the actions of the rule should be done and when not. This
    qualification can only reference the pseudorelations <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</VAR
> and/or <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</VAR
>,
    which basically represent the relation that was given as object (but with a
    special meaning).</P
><P
>    So we have four cases that produce the following query trees for
    a one-action rule.

    <P
></P
></P><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>No qualification and not <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the original query
        tree's qualification added
       </P
></DD
><DT
>No qualification but <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the original query
        tree's qualification added
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Qualification given and not <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the rule
        qualification and the original query tree's qualification
        added
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Qualification given and <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the rule
        qualification and the original query tree's qualification; and
        the original query tree with the negated rule qualification
        added
       </P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P>

    Finally, if the rule is not <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
>, the unchanged original query tree is
    added to the list. Since only qualified <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
> rules already add the
    original query tree, we end up with either one or two output query trees
    for a rule with one action.</P
><P
>    For <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON INSERT</VAR
> rules, the original query (if not suppressed by <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</VAR
>)
    is done before any actions added by rules.  This allows the actions to
    see the inserted row(s).  But for <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON UPDATE</VAR
> and <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON
    DELETE</VAR
> rules, the original query is done after the actions added by rules.
    This ensures that the actions can see the to-be-updated or to-be-deleted
    rows; otherwise, the actions might do nothing because they find no rows
    matching their qualifications.</P
><P
>    The query trees generated from rule actions are thrown into the
    rewrite system again, and maybe more rules get applied resulting
    in more or less query trees.
    So the query trees in the rule actions must have either a different command type
    or a different result relation, otherwise, this recursive process will end up in a loop.
    There is a fixed recursion limit of currently 100 iterations.
    If after 100 iterations there are still update rules to apply, the
    rule system assumes a loop over multiple rule definitions and reports
    an error.</P
><P
>    The query trees found in the actions of the
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_rewrite</TT
> system catalog are only
    templates. Since they can reference the range-table entries for
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</VAR
> and <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</VAR
>, some substitutions have to be made before they can be
    used. For any reference to <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</VAR
>, the target list of the original
    query is searched for a corresponding entry. If found, that
    entry's expression replaces the reference. Otherwise, <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</VAR
> means the
    same as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</VAR
> (for an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>) or is replaced by
    a null value (for an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>). Any reference to <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</VAR
> is
    replaced by a reference to the range-table entry that is the
    result relation.</P
><P
>    After the system is done applying update rules, it applies view rules to the
    produced query tree(s).  Views cannot insert new update actions so
    there is no need to apply update rules to the output of view rewriting.</P

    (This looks a little strange since you can't normally write
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT ... VALUES ... FROM</VAR

    in the query tree for <VAR

    These are needed so that they can be referenced by variables in

><P
>    The rule is a qualified non-<VAR

    has to return two query trees: the modified rule action and the original
    query tree. In step 1, the range table of the original query is
    incorporated into the rule's action query tree. This results in:

</P><PRE

       <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data shoelace_data</B

    In step 2, the rule qualification is added to it, so the result set
    is restricted to rows where <VAR

>sl_avail</VAR

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (

    (This looks even stranger, since <VAR

>INSERT ... VALUES</VAR

    a <VAR

    difficulty with it.  They need to support this same functionality
    anyway for <VAR

>INSERT ... SELECT</VAR

   </P
><P
>    In step 3, the original query tree's qualification is added,
    restricting the result set further to only the rows that would have been touched

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

>    Step 4 replaces references to <VAR

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

   </P

   </P

    is a list of two query trees that correspond to these statements:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';

UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 6

><P>

    These are executed in this order, and that is exactly what
    the rule was meant to do.
   </P
><P
>    The substitutions and the added qualifications
    ensure that, if the original query would be, say,

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_color = 'green'
 WHERE sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

    no log entry would get written.  In that case, the original query
    tree does not contain a target list entry for
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl_avail</VAR
>, so <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW.sl_avail</VAR
> will get
    replaced by <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_data.sl_avail</VAR
>.  Thus, the extra
    command generated by the rule is

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       shoelace_data.sl_name, <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

> &lt;&gt; shoelace_data.sl_avail
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE

    and that qualification will never be true.
   </P
><P
>    It will also work if the original query modifies multiple rows. So
    if someone issued the command

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 0

    four rows in fact get updated (<VAR

    in the extra query tree

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
