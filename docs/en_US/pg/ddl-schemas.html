    can be used too, but at present this is just for pro-forma compliance
    with the SQL standard; if you write a database name it must be the
    same as the database you are connected to.
   </P
><P
>    So to create a table in the new schema, use
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE myschema.mytable (
 ...
);</PRE

    This works anywhere a table name is expected, including the table
    modification commands and the data access commands discussed in
    the following chapters.

    dropped), use
</P><PRE

><P>
    To drop a schema including all contained objects, use
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;</PRE
><P>
    See <A
HREF="ddl-depend.html"
>Section 5.10</A
> for a description of the general
    mechanism behind this.
   </P
><P
>    Often you will want to create a schema owned by someone else
    (since this is one of the ways to restrict the activities of your

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE SCHEMA <VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>schemaname</VAR
> AUTHORIZATION <VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>username</VAR

    You can even omit the schema name, in which case the schema name
    will be the same as the user name.  See <A

>Section 5.8.6</A
> for how this can be useful.
   </P

>    Qualified names are tedious to write, and it's often best not to
    wire a particular schema name into applications anyway.  Therefore
    tables are often referred to by <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>unqualified names</I
>,
    which consist of just the table name.  The system determines which table
    is meant by following a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>search path</I
>, which is a list
    of schemas to look in.  The first matching table in the search path
    is taken to be the one wanted.  If there is no match in the search
    path, an error is reported, even if matching table names exist
    in other schemas in the database.
   </P
><P
>    The first schema named in the search path is called the current schema.
    Aside from being the first schema searched, it is also the schema in
    which new tables will be created if the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE TABLE</TT
>
    command does not specify a schema name.
   </P
><P
>    To show the current search path, use the following command:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SHOW search_path;</PRE
><P>
    In the default setup this returns:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
> search_path
--------------
 $user,public</PRE
><P>
    The first element specifies that a schema with the same name as
    the current user is to be searched.  Since no such schema exists
    yet, this entry is ignored.  The second element refers to the
    public schema that we have seen already.
   </P
><P
>    The first schema in the search path that exists is the default
    location for creating new objects.  That is the reason that by
    default objects are created in the public schema.  When objects
    are referenced in any other context without schema qualification
    (table modification, data modification, or query commands) the
    search path is traversed until a matching object is found.
    Therefore, in the default configuration, any unqualified access
    again can only refer to the public schema.
   </P
><P
>    To put our new schema in the path, we use
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SET search_path TO myschema,public;</PRE
><P>
    (We omit the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$user</VAR
> here because we have no
    immediate need for it.)  And then we can access the table without
    schema qualification:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>DROP TABLE mytable;</PRE
><P>
    Also, since <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>myschema</VAR
> is the first element in
    the path, new objects would by default be created in it.
   </P
><P
>    We could also have written
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SET search_path TO myschema;</PRE
><P>
    Then we no longer have access to the public schema without
    explicit qualification.  There is nothing special about the public
    schema except that it exists by default.  It can be dropped, too.
   </P
><P
>    See also <A
HREF="functions-misc.html"
>Section 9.13</A
> for other ways to access
    the schema search path.
   </P
><P
>    The search path works in the same way for data type names, function names,
    and operator names as it does for table names.  Data type and function
    names can be qualified in exactly the same way as table names.  If you
    need to write a qualified operator name in an expression, there is a
    special provision: you must write
</P><PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
><VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OPERATOR(</VAR
><VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>schema</VAR
><VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.</VAR
><VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>operator</VAR
><VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>)</VAR
></PRE
><P>
    This is needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity.  An example is
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT 3 OPERATOR(pg_catalog.+) 4;</PRE
><P>
    In practice one usually relies on the search path for operators,
    so as not to have to write anything so ugly as that.

    <P

><LI
><P
>       If you do not create any schemas then all users access the
       public schema implicitly.  This simulates the situation where
       schemas are not available at all.  This setup is mainly
       recommended when there is only a single user or a few cooperating
       users in a database.  This setup also allows smooth transition
       from the non-schema-aware world.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       You can create a schema for each user with the same name as
       that user.  Recall that the default search path starts with
       <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$user</VAR
>, which resolves to the user name.
       Therefore, if each user has a separate schema, they access their
       own schemas by default.
      </P
><P
>       If you use this setup then you might also want to revoke access

></LI
><LI
><P
>       To install shared applications (tables to be used by everyone,
       additional functions provided by third parties, etc.), put them
       into separate schemas.  Remember to grant appropriate
       privileges to allow the other users to access them.  Users can
       then refer to these additional objects by qualifying the names
       with a schema name, or they can put the additional schemas into
       their path, as they choose.

    being owned by different users does not exist.  Moreover, some
    implementations do not allow you to create schemas that have a
    different name than their owner.  In fact, the concepts of schema
    and user are nearly equivalent in a database system that
    implements only the basic schema support specified in the
