><P
> The <TT

 has options to read from or write to the network connection used by
 <SPAN

 allow applications to take advantage of this capability by supplying or
 consuming copied data.</P
><P
> The overall process is that the application first issues the SQL
 <TT

 of the equivalent functions.  The response to this (if there is no error
 in the command) will be a <TT

 code of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_OUT</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_IN</TT

 (depending on the specified copy direction).  The application should then
 use the functions of this section to receive or transmit data rows.
 When the data transfer is complete, another <TT

>PGresult</TT

 is returned to indicate success or failure of the transfer.  Its status
 will be <TT

 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_FATAL_ERROR</TT
> if some problem was encountered.
 At this point further SQL commands may be issued via
 <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

 commands using the same connection while the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT

 operation is in progress.)</P
><P
> If a <TT

 This function waits until
 the  server  has  finished  the copying.  It should
 either be issued when the  last  string  has  been
 sent  to  the  server using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQputline</CODE
> or when the
 last string has been  received  from  the  server
 using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PGgetline</CODE
>.  It must be issued or the server
 will get <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"out of sync"</SPAN
> with  the client.   Upon
 return from this function, the server is ready to
 receive the next SQL command.
 The return value is 0  on  successful  completion,
 nonzero otherwise.  (Use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQerrorMessage</CODE
> to retrieve
 details if the return value is nonzero.)</P
><P
>When using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
>, the application should respond to
a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_OUT</TT
> result by executing <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetline</CODE
>
repeatedly, followed by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQendcopy</CODE
> after the terminator line is seen.
It should then return to the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> loop until
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> returns a null pointer. Similarly a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_IN</TT

result is processed by a series of <CODE

>PQputline</CODE
> calls followed by
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQendcopy</CODE
>, then return to the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> loop.
This arrangement will ensure that
a <TT

will be executed correctly.</P
