<a name="r1-app-pgresetxlog-1"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> clears the write-ahead log (WAL) and
   optionally resets some other control information stored in the
   <code class="filename">pg_control</code> file.  This function is sometimes needed
   if these files have become corrupted.  It should be used only as a
   last resort, when the server will not start due to such corruption.
  </p>
<p>   After running this command, it should be possible to start the server,
   but bear in mind that the database may contain inconsistent data due to
   partially-committed transactions.  You should immediately dump your data,
   run <code class="command">initdb</code>, and reload.  After reload, check for
   inconsistencies and repair as needed.
  </p>
<p>   This utility can only be run by the user who installed the server, because
   it requires read/write access to the data directory.
   For safety reasons, you must specify the data directory on the command line.
   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> does not use the environment variable
   <code class="envar">PGDATA</code>.
  </p>
<p>   If <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> complains that it cannot determine
   valid data for <code class="filename">pg_control</code>, you can force it to proceed anyway
   by specifying the <code class="literal">-f</code> (force) switch.  In this case plausible
   values will be substituted for the missing data.  Most of the fields can be
   expected to match, but manual assistance may be needed for the next OID,
   next transaction ID and epoch, next multitransaction ID and offset,
   WAL starting address, and database locale fields.
   The first six of these can be set using the switches discussed below.
   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code>'s own environment is the source for its
   guess at the locale fields; take care that <code class="envar">LANG</code> and so forth
   match the environment that <code class="command">initdb</code> was run in.
   If you are not able to determine correct values for all these fields,
   <code class="literal">-f</code> can still be used, but
   the recovered database must be treated with even more suspicion than
   usual: an immediate dump and reload is imperative.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Do not</em></span>
   execute any data-modifying operations in the database before you dump;
   as any such action is likely to make the corruption worse.
  </p>
<p>   The <code class="literal">-o</code>, <code class="literal">-x</code>, <code class="literal">-e</code>,
   <code class="literal">-m</code>, <code class="literal">-O</code>,
   and <code class="literal">-l</code>
   switches allow the next OID, next transaction ID, next transaction ID's
   epoch, next multitransaction ID, next multitransaction offset, and WAL
   starting address values to be set manually.  These are only needed when
   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> is unable to determine appropriate values
   by reading <code class="filename">pg_control</code>.  Safe values may be determined as
   follows:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      A safe value for the next transaction ID (<code class="literal">-x</code>)
      may be determined by looking for the numerically largest
      file name in the directory <code class="filename">pg_clog</code> under the data directory,
      adding one,
      and then multiplying by 1048576.  Note that the file names are in
      hexadecimal.  It is usually easiest to specify the switch value in
      hexadecimal too. For example, if <code class="filename">0011</code> is the largest entry
      in <code class="filename">pg_clog</code>, <code class="literal">-x 0x1200000</code> will work (five
      trailing zeroes provide the proper multiplier).
     </p></li>
<li><p>      A safe value for the next multitransaction ID (<code class="literal">-m</code>)
      may be determined by looking for the numerically largest
      file name in the directory <code class="filename">pg_multixact/offsets</code> under the
      data directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536.  As above,
      the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way to do this is to
      specify the switch value in hexadecimal and add four zeroes.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      A safe value for the next multitransaction offset (<code class="literal">-O</code>)
      may be determined by looking for the numerically largest
      file name in the directory <code class="filename">pg_multixact/members</code> under the
      data directory, adding one, and then multiplying by 65536.  As above,
      the file names are in hexadecimal, so the easiest way to do this is to
      specify the switch value in hexadecimal and add four zeroes.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      The WAL starting address (<code class="literal">-l</code>) should be
      larger than any file name currently existing in
      the directory <code class="filename">pg_xlog</code> under the data directory.
      These names are also in hexadecimal and have three parts.  The first
      part is the <span class="quote">timeline ID</span> and should usually be kept the same.
      Do not choose a value larger than 255 (<code class="literal">0xFF</code>) for the third
      part; instead increment the second part and reset the third part to 0.
      For example, if <code class="filename">00000001000000320000004A</code> is the
      largest entry in <code class="filename">pg_xlog</code>, <code class="literal">-l 0x1,0x32,0x4B</code> will
      work; but if the largest entry is
      <code class="filename">000000010000003A000000FF</code>, choose <code class="literal">-l 0x1,0x3B,0x0</code>
      or more.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      There is no comparably easy way to determine a next OID that's beyond
      the largest one in the database, but fortunately it is not critical to
      get the next-OID setting right.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      The transaction ID epoch is not actually stored anywhere in the database
      except in the field that is set by <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code>,
      so any value will work so far as the database itself is concerned.
      You might need to adjust this value to ensure that replication
      systems such as <span class="application">Slony-I</span> work correctly &#8212;
      if so, an appropriate value should be obtainable from the state of
      the downstream replicated database.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   The <code class="literal">-n</code> (no operation) switch instructs
   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> to print the values reconstructed from
   <code class="filename">pg_control</code> and then exit without modifying anything.
   This is mainly a debugging tool, but may be useful as a sanity check
   before allowing <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> to proceed for real.

<a name="id2793450"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>   This command must not be used when the server is 
   running.  <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> will refuse to start up if
   it finds a server lock file in the data directory.  If the
   server crashed then a lock file may have been left
   behind; in that case you can remove the lock file to allow
   <code class="command">pg_resetxlog</code> to run.  But before you do
   so, make doubly certain that there is no server process still alive.
