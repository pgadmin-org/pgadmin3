  or affects a lot of users, chances are good that someone will look into it. It
  could also happen that we tell you to update to a newer version to see if the
  bug happens there. Or we might decide that the bug
  cannot be fixed before some major rewrite we might be planning is done. Or
  perhaps it is simply too hard and there are more important things on the agenda.
  If you need help immediately, consider obtaining a commercial support contract.

><P
>   Before you report a bug, please read and re-read the
   documentation to verify that you can really do whatever it is you are
   trying. If it is not clear from the documentation whether you can do
   something or not, please report that too; it is a bug in the documentation.
   If it turns out that a program does something different from what the
   documentation says, that is a bug. That might include, but is not limited to,
   the following circumstances:

   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      A program terminates with a fatal signal or an operating system
      error message that would point to a problem in the program. (A
      counterexample might be a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"disk full"</SPAN
> message,
      since you have to fix that yourself.)
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      A program produces the wrong output for any given input.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      A program refuses to accept valid input (as defined in the documentation).
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      A program accepts invalid input without a notice or error message.
      But keep in mind that your idea of invalid input might be our idea of
      an extension or compatibility with traditional practice.

   not necessarily a bug either, unless compliance for the
   specific feature is explicitly claimed.
  </P

>What to report</A
></H2
><P
>   The most important thing to remember about bug reporting is to state all
   the facts and only facts. Do not speculate what you think went wrong, what
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"it seemed to do"</SPAN
>, or which part of the program has a fault.
   If you are not familiar with the implementation you would probably guess
   wrong and not help us a bit. And even if you are, educated explanations are
   a great supplement to but no substitute for facts. If we are going to fix
   the bug we still have to see it happen for ourselves first.
   Reporting the bare facts
   is relatively straightforward (you can probably copy and paste them from the
   screen) but all too often important details are left out because someone
   thought it does not matter or the report would be understood
   anyway.
  </P
><P
>   The following items should be contained in every bug report:

   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      The exact sequence of steps <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>from program
      start-up</I
></SPAN
> necessary to reproduce the problem. This
      should be self-contained; it is not enough to send in a bare
      <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> statement without the preceding
      <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE TABLE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>
      statements, if the output should depend on the data in the
      tables. We do not have the time to reverse-engineer your
      database schema, and if we are supposed to make up our own data
      we would probably miss the problem.
     </P
><P
>      The best format for a test case for SQL-related problems is a
      file that can be run through the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>
      frontend that shows the problem. (Be sure to not have anything
      in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.psqlrc</TT
> start-up file.)  An easy
      start at this file is to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>
      to dump out the table declarations and data needed to set the
      scene, then add the problem query.  You are encouraged to
      minimize the size of your example, but this is not absolutely
      necessary.  If the bug is reproducible, we will find it either
      way.
     </P
><P
>      If your application uses some other client interface, such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PHP</SPAN
>, then
      please try to isolate the offending queries. We will probably not set up a
      web server to reproduce your problem. In any case remember to provide
      the exact input files; do not guess that the problem happens for
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"large files"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"midsize databases"</SPAN
>, etc. since this
      information is too inexact to be of use.
     </P

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"didn't work"</SPAN
> or
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"crashed"</SPAN
>. If there is an error message,
      show it, even if you do not understand it. If the program terminates with
      an operating system error, say which. If nothing at all happens, say so.
      Even if the result of your test case is a program crash or otherwise obvious
      it might not happen on our platform. The easiest thing is to copy the output
      from the terminal, if possible.

      If the function or the options do not exist then your version is

      C library, processor, memory information, and so on. In most
      cases it is sufficient to report the vendor and version, but do
      not assume everyone knows what exactly <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

      installation problems then information about the toolchain on

      on) is also necessary.

   Do not be afraid if your bug report becomes rather lengthy. That is a fact of life.
   It is better to report everything the first time than us having to squeeze the
   facts out of you. On the other hand, if your input files are huge, it is
   fair to ask first whether somebody is interested in looking into it.
  </P
><P
>   Do not spend all your time to figure out which changes in the input make
   the problem go away. This will probably not help solving it. If it turns
   out that the bug cannot be fixed right away, you will still have time to
   find and share your work-around. Also, once again, do not waste your time
   guessing why the bug exists. We will find that out soon enough.
  </P
><P
>   When writing a bug report, please avoid confusing terminology.
   The software package in total is called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"PostgreSQL"</SPAN
>,
   sometimes <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Postgres"</SPAN
> for short. If you
   are specifically talking about the backend server, mention that, do not
   just say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"PostgreSQL crashes"</SPAN
>.  A crash of a single
   backend server process is quite different from crash of the parent
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"postmaster"</SPAN
> process; please don't say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the postmaster
   crashed"</SPAN
> when you mean a single backend process went down, nor vice versa.
   Also, client programs such as the interactive frontend <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>"</SPAN
>
   are completely separate from the backend.  Please try to be specific
   about whether the problem is on the client or server side.
