<a name="id522166"></a><p>   Data types are a way to limit the kind of data that can be stored
   in a table.  For many applications, however, the constraint they
   provide is too coarse.  For example, a column containing a product
   price should probably only accept positive values.  But there is no
   data type that accepts only positive numbers.  Another issue is
   that you might want to constrain column data with respect to other
   columns or rows.  For example, in a table containing product
   information, there should only be one row for each product number.
  </p>
<p>   To that end, SQL allows you to define constraints on columns and
   tables.  Constraints give you as much control over the data in your
   tables as you wish.  If a user attempts to store data in a column
   that would violate a constraint, an error is raised.  This applies
   even if the value came from the default value definition.
  </p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id522197"></a>5.3.1. Check Constraints</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id522201"></a><a name="id522208"></a><p>    A check constraint is the most generic constraint type.  It allows
    you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a
    Boolean (truth-value) expression.  For instance, to require positive
    product prices, you could use:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric <span><strong class="emphasis">CHECK (price &gt; 0)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    As you see, the constraint definition comes after the data type,
    just like default value definitions.  Default values and
    constraints can be listed in any order.  A check constraint
    consists of the key word <code class="literal">CHECK</code> followed by an
    expression in parentheses.  The check constraint expression should
    involve the column thus constrained, otherwise the constraint
    would not make too much sense.
   </p>
<a name="id522251"></a><p>    You can also give the constraint a separate name.  This clarifies
    error messages and allows you to refer to the constraint when you
    need to change it.  The syntax is:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric <span><strong class="emphasis">CONSTRAINT positive_price</strong></span> CHECK (price &gt; 0)
);</pre>
<p>
    So, to specify a named constraint, use the key word
    <code class="literal">CONSTRAINT</code> followed by an identifier followed
    by the constraint definition.  (If you don't specify a constraint
    name in this way, the system chooses a name for you.)
   </p>
<p>    A check constraint can also refer to several columns.  Say you
    store a regular price and a discounted price, and you want to
    ensure that the discounted price is lower than the regular price.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric CHECK (price &gt; 0),
    discounted_price numeric CHECK (discounted_price &gt; 0),
    <span><strong class="emphasis">CHECK (price &gt; discounted_price)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    The first two constraints should look familiar.  The third one
    uses a new syntax.  It is not attached to a particular column,
    instead it appears as a separate item in the comma-separated
    column list.  Column definitions and these constraint
    definitions can be listed in mixed order.
   </p>
<p>    We say that the first two constraints are column constraints, whereas the
    third one is a table constraint because it is written separately
    from any one column definition.  Column constraints can also be
    written as table constraints, while the reverse is not necessarily
    possible, since a column constraint is supposed to refer to only the
    column it is attached to.  (<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> doesn't
    enforce that rule, but you should follow it if you want your table
    definitions to work with other database systems.)  The above example could
    also be written as
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric,
    CHECK (price &gt; 0),
    discounted_price numeric,
    CHECK (discounted_price &gt; 0),
    CHECK (price &gt; discounted_price)
);</pre>
<p>
    or even
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric CHECK (price &gt; 0),
    discounted_price numeric,
    CHECK (discounted_price &gt; 0 AND price &gt; discounted_price)
);</pre>
<p>
    It's a matter of taste.
   </p>
<p>    Names can be assigned to table constraints in just the same way as
    for column constraints:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric,
    CHECK (price &gt; 0),
    discounted_price numeric,
    CHECK (discounted_price &gt; 0),
    <span><strong class="emphasis">CONSTRAINT valid_discount</strong></span> CHECK (price &gt; discounted_price)
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<a name="id522385"></a><p>    It should be noted that a check constraint is satisfied if the
    check expression evaluates to true or the null value.  Since most
    expressions will evaluate to the null value if any operand is null,
    they will not prevent null values in the constrained columns.  To
    ensure that a column does not contain null values, the not-null
    constraint described in the next section can be used.
   </p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id522407"></a>5.3.2. Not-Null Constraints</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id522411"></a><a name="id522418"></a><p>    A not-null constraint simply specifies that a column must not
    assume the null value.  A syntax example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">NOT NULL</strong></span>,
    name text <span><strong class="emphasis">NOT NULL</strong></span>,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    A not-null constraint is always written as a column constraint.  A
    not-null constraint is functionally equivalent to creating a check
    constraint <code class="literal">CHECK (<em class="replaceable"><code>column_name</code></em>
    IS NOT NULL)</code>, but in
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> creating an explicit
    not-null constraint is more efficient.  The drawback is that you
    cannot give explicit names to not-null constraints created that
    way.
   </p>
<p>    Of course, a column can have more than one constraint.  Just write
    the constraints one after another:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    price numeric NOT NULL CHECK (price &gt; 0)
);</pre>
<p>
    The order doesn't matter.  It does not necessarily determine in which
    order the constraints are checked.
   </p>
<p>    The <code class="literal">NOT NULL</code> constraint has an inverse: the
    <code class="literal">NULL</code> constraint.  This does not mean that the
    column must be null, which would surely be useless.  Instead, this
    simply selects the default behavior that the column may be null.
    The <code class="literal">NULL</code> constraint is not defined in the SQL
    standard and should not be used in portable applications.  (It was
    only added to <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> to be
    compatible with some other database systems.)  Some users, however,
    like it because it makes it easy to toggle the constraint in a
    script file.  For example, you could start with
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer NULL,
    name text NULL,
    price numeric NULL
);</pre>
<p>
    and then insert the <code class="literal">NOT</code> key word where desired.
   </p>
<div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
<p>     In most database designs the majority of columns should be marked
     not null.

<a name="id522549"></a>5.3.3. Unique Constraints</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id522553"></a><a name="id522560"></a><p>    Unique constraints ensure that the data contained in a column or a
    group of columns is unique with respect to all the rows in the
    table.  The syntax is
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">UNIQUE</strong></span>,
    name text,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>
    when written as a column constraint, and
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric,
    <span><strong class="emphasis">UNIQUE (product_no)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
    when written as a table constraint.
   </p>
<p>    If a unique constraint refers to a group of columns, the columns
    are listed separated by commas:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE example (
    a integer,
    b integer,
    c integer,
    <span><strong class="emphasis">UNIQUE (a, c)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
    This specifies that the combination of values in the indicated columns
    is unique across the whole table, though any one of the columns
    need not be (and ordinarily isn't) unique.
   </p>
<p>    You can assign your own name for a unique constraint, in the usual way:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">CONSTRAINT must_be_different</strong></span> UNIQUE,
    name text,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<a name="id522635"></a><p>    In general, a unique constraint is violated when there are two or
    more rows in the table where the values of all of the
    columns included in the constraint are equal.
    However, null values are not considered equal in this
    comparison.  That means even in the presence of a
    unique constraint it is possible to store an unlimited number of
    rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained
    columns.  This behavior conforms to the SQL standard, but we have
    heard that other SQL databases may not follow this rule.  So be
    careful when developing applications that are intended to be
    portable.

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id522660"></a>5.3.4. Primary Keys</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id522664"></a><a name="id522671"></a><p>    Technically, a primary key constraint is simply a combination of a
    unique constraint and a not-null constraint.  So, the following
    two table definitions accept the same data:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name text,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">PRIMARY KEY</strong></span>,
    name text,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Primary keys can also constrain more than one column; the syntax
    is similar to unique constraints:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE example (
    a integer,
    b integer,
    c integer,
    <span><strong class="emphasis">PRIMARY KEY (a, c)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    A primary key indicates that a column or group of columns can be
    used as a unique identifier for rows in the table.  (This is a
    direct consequence of the definition of a primary key.  Note that
    a unique constraint does not, by itself, provide a unique identifier
    because it does not exclude null values.)  This is useful both for
    documentation purposes and for client applications.  For example,
    a GUI application that allows modifying row values probably needs
    to know the primary key of a table to be able to identify rows
    uniquely.
   </p>
<p>    A table can have at most one primary key (while it can have many
    unique and not-null constraints).  Relational database theory
    dictates that every table must have a primary key.  This rule is
    not enforced by <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, but it is
    usually best to follow it.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ddl-constraints-fk"></a>5.3.5. Foreign Keys</h3></div></div></div>
<a name="id522756"></a><a name="id522763"></a><a name="id522772"></a><p>    A foreign key constraint specifies that the values in a column (or
    a group of columns) must match the values appearing in some row
    of another table.
    We say this maintains the <em class="firstterm">referential
    integrity</em> between two related tables.
   </p>
<p>    Say you have the product table that we have used several times already:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    price numeric
);</pre>
<p>
    Let's also assume you have a table storing orders of those
    products.  We want to ensure that the orders table only contains
    orders of products that actually exist.  So we define a foreign
    key constraint in the orders table that references the products
    table:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">REFERENCES products (product_no)</strong></span>,
    quantity integer
);</pre>
<p>
    Now it is impossible to create orders with
    <code class="structfield">product_no</code> entries that do not appear in the
    products table.
   </p>
<p>    We say that in this situation the orders table is the
    <em class="firstterm">referencing</em> table and the products table is
    the <em class="firstterm">referenced</em> table.  Similarly, there are
    referencing and referenced columns.
   </p>
<p>    You can also shorten the above command to
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    product_no integer <span><strong class="emphasis">REFERENCES products</strong></span>,
    quantity integer
);</pre>
<p>
    because in absence of a column list the primary key of the
    referenced table is used as the referenced column(s).
   </p>
<p>    A foreign key can also constrain and reference a group of columns.
    As usual, it then needs to be written in table constraint form.
    Here is a contrived syntax example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE t1 (
  a integer PRIMARY KEY,
  b integer,
  c integer,
  <span><strong class="emphasis">FOREIGN KEY (b, c) REFERENCES other_table (c1, c2)</strong></span>
);</pre>
<p>
    Of course, the number and type of the constrained columns need to
    match the number and type of the referenced columns.
   </p>
<p>    You can assign your own name for a foreign key constraint,
    in the usual way.
   </p>
<p>    A table can contain more than one foreign key constraint.  This is
    used to implement many-to-many relationships between tables.  Say
    you have tables about products and orders, but now you want to
    allow one order to contain possibly many products (which the
    structure above did not allow).  You could use this table structure:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    price numeric
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    shipping_address text,
    ...
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    product_no integer REFERENCES products,
    order_id integer REFERENCES orders,
    quantity integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id)
);</pre>
<p>
    Notice that the primary key overlaps with the foreign keys in
    the last table.
   </p>
<a name="id522903"></a><a name="id522912"></a><p>    We know that the foreign keys disallow creation of orders that
    do not relate to any products.  But what if a product is removed
    after an order is created that references it?  SQL allows you to
    handle that as well.  Intuitively, we have a few options:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc" compact>
<li><p>Disallow deleting a referenced product</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the orders as well</p></li>
<li><p>Something else?</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    To illustrate this, let's implement the following policy on the
    many-to-many relationship example above: when someone wants to
    remove a product that is still referenced by an order (via
    <code class="literal">order_items</code>), we disallow it.  If someone
    removes an order, the order items are removed as well.
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    price numeric
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    shipping_address text,
    ...
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    product_no integer REFERENCES products <span><strong class="emphasis">ON DELETE RESTRICT</strong></span>,
    order_id integer REFERENCES orders <span><strong class="emphasis">ON DELETE CASCADE</strong></span>,
    quantity integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id)
);</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Restricting and cascading deletes are the two most common options.
    <code class="literal">RESTRICT</code> prevents deletion of a
    referenced row. <code class="literal">NO ACTION</code> means that if any
    referencing rows still exist when the constraint is checked, an error
    is raised; this is the default behavior if you do not specify anything.
    (The essential difference between these two choices is that
    <code class="literal">NO ACTION</code> allows the check to be deferred until
    later in the transaction, whereas <code class="literal">RESTRICT</code> does not.)
    <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> specifies that when a referenced row is deleted,
    row(s) referencing it should be automatically deleted as well.
    There are two other options:
    <code class="literal">SET NULL</code> and <code class="literal">SET DEFAULT</code>.
    These cause the referencing columns to be set to nulls or default
    values, respectively, when the referenced row is deleted.
    Note that these do not excuse you from observing any constraints.
    For example, if an action specifies <code class="literal">SET DEFAULT</code>
    but the default value would not satisfy the foreign key, the
    operation will fail.
   </p>
<p>    Analogous to <code class="literal">ON DELETE</code> there is also
    <code class="literal">ON UPDATE</code> which is invoked when a referenced
    column is changed (updated).  The possible actions are the same.
   </p>
<p>    More information about updating and deleting data is in <a href="dml.html" title="Chapter 6. Data Manipulation">Chapter 6, <i>Data Manipulation</i></a>.
   </p>
<p>    Finally, we should mention that a foreign key must reference
    columns that either are a primary key or form a unique constraint.
    If the foreign key references a unique constraint, there are some
    additional possibilities regarding how null values are matched.
    These are explained in the reference documentation for
    <a href="sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE</a>.
