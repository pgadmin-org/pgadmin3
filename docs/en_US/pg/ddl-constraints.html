>   Data types are a way to limit the kind of data that can be stored
   in a table.  For many applications, however, the constraint they
   provide is too coarse.  For example, a column containing a product
   price should probably only accept positive values.  But there is no
   data type that accepts only positive numbers.  Another issue is
   that you might want to constrain column data with respect to other
   columns or rows.  For example, in a table containing product
   information, there should only be one row for each product number.
  </P
><P
>   To that end, SQL allows you to define constraints on columns and
   tables.  Constraints give you as much control over the data in your
   tables as you wish.  If a user attempts to store data in a column
   that would violate a constraint, an error is raised.  This applies
   even if the value came from the default value definition.

>    A check constraint is the most generic constraint type.  It allows
    you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a
    Boolean (truth-value) expression.  For instance, to require positive
    product prices, you could use:
</P><PRE

   </P
><P
>    As you see, the constraint definition comes after the data type,
    just like default value definitions.  Default values and
    constraints can be listed in any order.  A check constraint
    consists of the key word <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CHECK</TT
> followed by an
    expression in parentheses.  The check constraint expression should
    involve the column thus constrained, otherwise the constraint
    would not make too much sense.

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    by the constraint definition.  (If you don't specify a constraint
    name in this way, the system chooses a name for you.)

    definitions can be listed in mixed order.
   </P

    However, null values are not considered equal in this
    comparison.  That means even in the presence of a
    unique constraint it is possible to store an unlimited number of
    rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained
    columns.  This behavior conforms to the SQL standard, but we have
