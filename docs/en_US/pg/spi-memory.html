<p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> allocates memory within
   <em class="firstterm">memory contexts</em><a name="id2708311"></a>, which provide a convenient method of
   managing allocations made in many different places that need to
   live for differing amounts of time.  Destroying a context releases
   all the memory that was allocated in it.  Thus, it is not necessary
   to keep track of individual objects to avoid memory leaks; instead
   only a relatively small number of contexts have to be managed.
   <code class="function">palloc</code> and related functions allocate memory
   from the &#8220;<span class="quote">current</span>&#8221; context.
  </p>
<p>   <code class="function">SPI_connect</code> creates a new memory context and
   makes it current.  <code class="function">SPI_finish</code> restores the
   previous current memory context and destroys the context created by
   <code class="function">SPI_connect</code>.  These actions ensure that
   transient memory allocations made inside your procedure are
   reclaimed at procedure exit, avoiding memory leakage.
  </p>
<p>   However, if your procedure needs to return an object in allocated
   memory (such as a value of a pass-by-reference data type), you
   cannot allocate that memory using <code class="function">palloc</code>, at
   least not while you are connected to SPI.  If you try, the object
   will be deallocated by <code class="function">SPI_finish</code>, and your
   procedure will not work reliably.  To solve this problem, use
   <code class="function">SPI_palloc</code> to allocate memory for your return
   object.  <code class="function">SPI_palloc</code> allocates memory in the
   &#8220;<span class="quote">upper executor context</span>&#8221;, that is, the memory context
   that was current when <code class="function">SPI_connect</code> was called,
   which is precisely the right context for a value returned from your
   procedure.
  </p>
<p>   If <code class="function">SPI_palloc</code> is called while the procedure is
   not connected to SPI, then it acts the same as a normal
   <code class="function">palloc</code>.  Before a procedure connects to the
   SPI manager, the current memory context is the upper executor
   context, so all allocations made by the procedure via
   <code class="function">palloc</code> or by SPI utility functions are made in
   this context.
  </p>
<p>   When <code class="function">SPI_connect</code> is called, the private
   context of the procedure, which is created by
   <code class="function">SPI_connect</code>, is made the current context.  All
   allocations made by <code class="function">palloc</code>,
   <code class="function">repalloc</code>, or SPI utility functions (except for
   <code class="function">SPI_copytuple</code>,
   <code class="function">SPI_returntuple</code>,
   <code class="function">SPI_modifytuple</code>, and
   <code class="function">SPI_palloc</code>) are made in this context.  When a
   procedure disconnects from the SPI manager (via
   <code class="function">SPI_finish</code>) the current context is restored to
   the upper executor context, and all allocations made in the
   procedure memory context are freed and cannot be used any more.
  </p>
<p>   All functions described in this section may be used by both
   connected and unconnected procedures.  In an unconnected procedure,
   they act the same as the underlying ordinary server functions
   (<code class="function">palloc</code>, etc.).
