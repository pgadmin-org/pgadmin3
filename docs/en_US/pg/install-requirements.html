>   Also check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need about
   65 MB for the source tree during compilation and about 15 MB for
   the installation directory. An empty database cluster takes about
   25 MB, databases take about five times the amount of space that a
   flat text file with the same data would take. If you are going to
   run the regression tests you will temporarily need up to an extra
   90 MB. Use the <TT

   space.
