<p> 
    This release contains improvements in many areas, demonstrating
    the continued growth of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
    There are more improvements and fixes in 7.0 than in any previous
    release. The developers have confidence that this is the best
    release yet; we do our best to put out only solid releases, and
    this one is no exception.
   </p>
<p>    Major changes in this release:
   </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">      Foreign Keys
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Foreign keys are now implemented, with the exception of PARTIAL MATCH
       foreign keys. Many users have been asking for this feature, and we are
       pleased to offer it.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Optimizer Overhaul
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Continuing on work started a year ago, the optimizer has been
       improved, allowing better query plan selection and faster performance
       with less memory usage.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Updated <span class="application">psql</span>
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       <span class="application">psql</span>, our interactive terminal monitor, has been
       updated with a variety of new features. See the <span class="application">psql</span> manual page for details.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Join Syntax
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       SQL92 join syntax is now supported, though only as
       <code class="literal">INNER JOIN</code> for this release. <code class="literal">JOIN</code>,
       <code class="literal">NATURAL JOIN</code>, <code class="literal">JOIN</code>/<code class="literal">USING</code>,
       and <code class="literal">JOIN</code>/<code class="literal">ON</code> are available, as are
       column correlation names.
      </p></dd>

<a name="id2869000"></a>E.66.1. Migration to version 7.0</h3></div></div></div>
<p>     A dump/restore using <span class="application">pg_dump</span>
     is required for those wishing to migrate data from any
     previous release of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
     For those upgrading from 6.5.*, you may instead use 
     <span class="application">pg_upgrade</span> to upgrade to this
     release; however, a full dump/reload installation is always the
     most robust method for upgrades.
    </p>
<p>     Interface and compatibility issues to consider for the new
     release include:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>       The date/time types <code class="type">datetime</code> and
       <code class="type">timespan</code> have been superseded by the
       SQL92-defined types <code class="type">timestamp</code> and
       <code class="type">interval</code>. Although there has been some effort to
       ease the transition by allowing
       <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> to recognize
       the deprecated type names and translate them to the new type
       names, this mechanism may not be completely transparent to
       your existing application.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       The optimizer has been substantially improved in the area of
       query cost estimation. In some cases, this will result in
       decreased query times as the optimizer makes a better choice
       for the preferred plan. However, in a small number of cases,
       usually involving pathological distributions of data, your
       query times may go up. If you are dealing with large amounts
       of data, you may want to check your queries to verify
       performance.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       The <acronym class="acronym">JDBC</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">ODBC</acronym>
       interfaces have been upgraded and extended.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       The string function <code class="function">CHAR_LENGTH</code> is now a
       native function. Previous versions translated this into a call
       to <code class="function">LENGTH</code>, which could result in
       ambiguity with other types implementing
       <code class="function">LENGTH</code> such as the geometric types.
      </p></li>
