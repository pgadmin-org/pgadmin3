> are points in the sequence of
   transactions at which it is guaranteed that the data files have
   been updated with all information logged before the checkpoint.  At
   checkpoint time, all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a
   special checkpoint record is written to the log file. As result, in
   the event of a crash, the recoverer knows from what point in the
   log (known as the redo record) it should start the REDO operation,
   since any changes made to data files before that record are already
   on disk. After a checkpoint has been made, any log segments written
   before the redo record are no longer needed and can be recycled or
   removed. (When <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> archiving is being done, the
   log segments must be archived before being recycled or removed.)
  </P

>   The server's background writer process will automatically perform
   a checkpoint every so often.  A checkpoint is created every <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-SEGMENTS"
>checkpoint_segments</A
> log segments, or every <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-TIMEOUT"
>checkpoint_timeout</A
> seconds, whichever comes first.
   The default settings are 3 segments and 300 seconds respectively.
   It is also possible to force a checkpoint by using the SQL command
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CHECKPOINT</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   Reducing <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
> and/or
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_timeout</TT
> causes checkpoints to be done
   more often. This allows faster after-crash recovery (since less work
   will need to be redone). However, one must balance this against the
   increased cost of flushing dirty data pages more often. In addition,
   to ensure data page consistency, the first modification of a data
   page after each checkpoint results in logging the entire page
   content. Thus a smaller checkpoint interval increases the volume of
   output to the WAL log, partially negating the goal of using a smaller
   interval, and in any case causing more disk I/O.
  </P
><P
>   Checkpoints are fairly expensive, first because they require writing
   out all currently dirty buffers, and second because they result in
   extra subsequent WAL traffic as discussed above.  It is therefore
   wise to set the checkpointing parameters high enough that checkpoints
   don't happen too often.  As a simple sanity check on your checkpointing
   parameters, you can set the <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-WARNING"
>checkpoint_warning</A
>
   parameter.  If checkpoints happen closer together than
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_warning</TT
> seconds, 
   a message will be output to the server log recommending increasing 
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
>.  Occasional appearance of such
   a message is not cause for alarm, but if it appears often then the
   checkpoint control parameters should be increased.
  </P
><P
>   There will be at least one WAL segment file, and will normally
   not be more than 2 * <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
> + 1
   files.  Each segment file is normally 16 MB (though this size can be
   altered when building the server).  You can use this to estimate space
   requirements for <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>.
   Ordinarily, when old log segment files are no longer needed, they
   are recycled (renamed to become the next segments in the numbered
   sequence). If, due to a short-term peak of log output rate, there
   are more than 2 * <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
> + 1
   segment files, the unneeded segment files will be deleted instead
   of recycled until the system gets back under this limit.

>   There are two commonly used <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> functions:
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
>.
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> is used to place a new record into
   the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers in shared memory. If there is no
   space for the new record, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> will have
   to write (move to kernel cache) a few filled <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
   buffers. This is undesirable because <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
>
   is used on every database low level modification (for example, row
   insertion) at a time when an exclusive lock is held on affected
   data pages, so the operation needs to be as fast as possible.  What
   is worse, writing <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers may also force the
   creation of a new log segment, which takes even more
   time. Normally, <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers should be written
   and flushed by a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
> request, which is
   made, for the most part, at transaction commit time to ensure that
   transaction records are flushed to permanent storage. On systems
   with high log output, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
> requests may
   not occur often enough to prevent <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
>
   from having to do writes.  On such systems
   one should increase the number of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers by
   modifying the configuration parameter <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-WAL-BUFFERS"
>wal_buffers</A
>.  The default number of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
   buffers is 8.  Increasing this value will
   correspondingly increase shared memory usage.  (It should be noted
   that there is presently little evidence to suggest that increasing
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_buffers</TT
> beyond the default is worthwhile.)
  </P
><P
>   The <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-COMMIT-DELAY"
>commit_delay</A
> parameter defines for how many
   microseconds the server process will sleep after writing a commit
   record to the log with <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> but before
   performing a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
>. This delay allows other
   server processes to add their commit records to the log so as to have all
   of them flushed with a single log sync. No sleep will occur if
   <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-FSYNC"
>fsync</A
>
   is not enabled, nor if fewer than <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-COMMIT-SIBLINGS"
>commit_siblings</A
>
   other sessions are currently in active transactions; this avoids
   sleeping when it's unlikely that any other session will commit soon.
   Note that on most platforms, the resolution of a sleep request is
   ten milliseconds, so that any nonzero <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>commit_delay</TT
>
   setting between 1 and 10000 microseconds would have the same effect.
   Good values for these parameters are not yet clear; experimentation
   is encouraged.
  </P
><P
>   The <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-WAL-SYNC-METHOD"
>wal_sync_method</A
> parameter determines how
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will ask the kernel to force
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> updates out to disk. 
   All the options should be the same as far as reliability goes,
   but it's quite platform-specific which one will be the fastest.
   Note that this parameter is irrelevant if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>fsync</TT
>
   has been turned off.
  </P
><P
>   Enabling the <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#GUC-WAL-DEBUG"
>wal_debug</A

   (provided that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

   compiled with support for it) will result in each

   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

   option may be replaced by a more general mechanism in the future.
