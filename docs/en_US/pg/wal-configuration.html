> are points in the sequence of
   transactions at which it is guaranteed that the data files have
   been updated with all information logged before the checkpoint.  At
   checkpoint time, all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a
   special checkpoint record is written to the log file. As result, in
   the event of a crash, the recoverer knows from what record in the
   log (known as the redo record) it should start the REDO operation,
   since any changes made to data files before that record are already
   on disk. After a checkpoint has been made, any log segments written
   before the redo records are no longer needed and can be recycled or
   removed. (When <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>-based <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BAR</ACRONYM
> is
   implemented, the log segments would be archived before being recycled
   or removed.)

>   The server spawns a special process every so often
   to create the next checkpoint.  A checkpoint is created every
   <VAR

>checkpoint_segments</VAR
> log segments, or every
   <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_timeout</VAR
> seconds, whichever comes first.
   The default settings are 3 segments and 300 seconds respectively.
   It is also possible to force a checkpoint by using the SQL command
   <TT

>   Reducing <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</VAR
> and/or
   <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_timeout</VAR
> causes checkpoints to be done
   more often. This allows faster after-crash recovery (since less work
   will need to be redone). However, one must balance this against the
   increased cost of flushing dirty data pages more often. In addition,
   to ensure data page consistency, the first modification of a data
   page after each checkpoint results in logging the entire page
   content. Thus a smaller checkpoint interval increases the volume of
   output to the log, partially negating the goal of using a smaller
   interval, and in any case causing more disk I/O.

>   There will be at least one 16 MB segment file, and will normally
   not be more than 2 * <VAR

   files.  You can use this to estimate space requirements for WAL.
   Ordinarily, when old log segment files are no longer needed, they
   are recycled (renamed to become the next segments in the numbered
   sequence). If, due to a short-term peak of log output rate, there
   are more than 2 * <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</VAR
> + 1
   segment files, the unneeded segment files will be deleted instead
   of recycled until the system gets back under this limit.

>   There are two commonly used <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> functions:
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
>.
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> is used to place a new record into
   the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers in shared memory. If there is no
   space for the new record, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> will have
   to write (move to kernel cache) a few filled <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
   buffers. This is undesirable because <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
>
   is used on every database low level modification (for example,
   row insertion) at a time when an exclusive lock is held on
   affected data pages, so the operation needs to be as fast as
   possible.  What is worse, writing <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers may
   also force the creation of a new log segment, which takes even more
   time. Normally, <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers should be written
   and flushed by a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
> request, which is
   made, for the most part, at transaction commit time to ensure that
   transaction records are flushed to permanent storage. On systems
   with high log output, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
> requests may
   not occur often enough to prevent <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers
   being written by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
>. On such systems
   one should increase the number of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers by
   modifying the configuration parameter <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_buffers</VAR
>.
   The default number of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>   WAL</ACRONYM
> buffers is 8.  Increasing this value will 
   correspondingly increase shared memory usage.
  </P
><P
>   Checkpoints are fairly expensive because they force all dirty kernel
   buffers to disk using the operating system <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sync()</VAR
> call.
   Busy servers may fill checkpoint segment files too quickly,
   causing excessive checkpointing. If such forced checkpoints happen
   more frequently than <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_warning</VAR
> seconds, 
   a message, will be output to the server logs recommending increasing 
   <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</VAR
>.
  </P
><P
>   The <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>commit_delay</VAR
> parameter defines for how many
   microseconds the server process will sleep after writing a commit
   record to the log with <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> but before
   performing a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
>. This delay allows other
   server processes to add their commit records to the log so as to have all
   of them flushed with a single log sync. No sleep will occur if
   <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>fsync</VAR
>
   is not enabled, nor if fewer than <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>commit_siblings</VAR
>
   other sessions are currently in active transactions; this avoids
   sleeping when it's unlikely that any other session will commit soon.
   Note that on most platforms, the resolution of a sleep request is
   ten milliseconds, so that any nonzero <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>commit_delay</VAR
>
   setting between 1 and 10000 microseconds would have the same effect.
   Good values for these parameters are not yet clear; experimentation
   is encouraged.
  </P
><P
>   The <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_sync_method</VAR
> parameter determines how
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will ask the kernel to force
    WAL updates out to disk. 
   All the options should be the same as far as reliability goes,
   but it's quite platform-specific which one will be the fastest.
   Note that this parameter is irrelevant if <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>fsync</VAR
>
   has been turned off.
  </P
><P
>   Setting the <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_debug</VAR
> parameter to any nonzero
   value will result in each <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</CODE
> and
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</CODE
> <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> call being
   logged to the server log.  At present, it makes no difference what
   the nonzero value is.  This option may be replaced by a more
   general mechanism in the future.
