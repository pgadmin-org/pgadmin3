><P
>    There are some general 6.3 issues that I want to mention.  These are
    only the big items that cannot be described in one sentence.  A review
    of the detailed changes list is still needed.
   </P
><P
>    First, we now have subselects.  Now that we have them, I would like to
    mention that without subselects, SQL is a very limited language.
    Subselects are a major feature, and you should review your code for
    places where subselects provide a better solution for your queries.  I
    think you will find that there are more uses for subselects than you may
    think.  Vadim has put us on the big SQL map with subselects, and fully
    functional ones too.  The only thing you can't do with subselects is to
    use them in the target list.
   </P
><P
>    Second, 6.3 uses Unix domain sockets rather than TCP/IP by default.  To
    enable connections from other machines, you have to use the new
    postmaster -i option, and of course edit <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
>.  Also, for this
    reason, the format of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
> has changed.
   </P
><P
>    Third, <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>char()</TT
> fields will now allow faster access than <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar()</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
>. Specifically, the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar()</TT
> have a penalty for access to
    any columns after the first column of this type.  <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>char()</TT
> used to also
    have this access penalty, but it no longer does.  This may suggest that
    you redesign some of your tables, especially if you have short character
    columns that you have defined as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar()</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
>.  This and other
    changes make 6.3 even faster than earlier releases.
   </P
><P
>    We now have passwords definable independent of any Unix file.  There are
    new SQL USER commands.
    See the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Administrator's Guide</I
> for more
    information.  There is a new table, pg_shadow, which is used to store
    user information and user passwords, and it by default only SELECT-able
    by the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>postgres</SPAN
> super-user.  pg_user is now a view of pg_shadow, and is
    SELECT-able by PUBLIC.  You should keep using pg_user in your
    application without changes.
   </P
><P
>    User-created tables now no longer have SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by
    default.  This was done because the ANSI standard requires it.  You can
    of course GRANT any privileges you want after the table is created. 
    System tables continue to be SELECT-able by PUBLIC.
   </P
><P
>    We also have real deadlock detection code.  No more sixty-second
    timeouts.  And the new locking code implements a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FIFO</ACRONYM
> better, so there
    should be less resource starvation during heavy use.
   </P
><P
>    Many complaints have been made about inadequate documentation in previous
    releases.  Thomas has put much effort into many new manuals for this
    release.  Check out the doc/ directory.
   </P
><P
>    For performance reasons, time travel is gone, but can be implemented
    using triggers (see <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pgsql/contrib/spi/README</TT
>).  Please check out the new
    \d command for types, operators, etc.  Also, views have their own
    privileges now, not based on the underlying tables, so privileges on
    them have to be set separately.  Check <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pgsql/interfaces</TT
> for some new
    ways to talk to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.
   </P
><P
>    This is the first release that really required an explanation for
    existing users.  In many ways, this was necessary because the new
    release removes many limitations, and the work-arounds people were using
    are no longer needed.
