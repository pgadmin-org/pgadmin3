>Description</H2
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
> obtains a table-level lock, waiting if
   necessary for any conflicting locks to be released.  Once obtained,
   the lock is held for the remainder of the current transaction.
   (There is no <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UNLOCK TABLE</TT
> command; locks are always
   released at transaction end.)
  </P
><P
>   When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference
   tables, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> always uses the least
   restrictive lock mode possible. <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
>
   provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking.
   For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the
   isolation level read committed and needs to ensure that data in a
   table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To
   achieve this you could obtain <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
> lock mode over the
   table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes
   and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of
   committed data, because <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
> lock mode conflicts with
   the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW EXCLUSIVE</VAR
> lock acquired by writers, and your
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE <VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>name</VAR
> IN SHARE MODE</TT
>
   statement will wait until any concurrent holders of <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</VAR
> mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you
   obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding;
   furthermore none can begin until you release the lock.
  </P
><P
>   To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the
   isolation level serializable, you have to execute the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK
   TABLE</TT
> statement before executing any data modification
   statement.  A serializable transaction's view of data will be
   frozen when its first data modification statement begins.  A later
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
> will still prevent concurrent writes --- but it
   won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to the
   latest committed values.
  </P
><P
>   If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the
   table, then it should use <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</VAR
> lock mode
   instead of <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
> mode.  This ensures that only one
   transaction of this type runs at a time.  Without this, a deadlock
   is possible: two transactions might both acquire <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
>
   mode, and then be unable to also acquire <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW EXCLUSIVE</VAR
>
   mode to actually perform their updates.  (Note that a transaction's
   own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</VAR
> mode when it holds <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
> mode --- but not
   if anyone else holds <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</VAR
> mode.)  To avoid deadlocks,
   make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the
   same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single
   object, then transactions should always acquire the most
   restrictive mode first.

CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
> only deals with table-level locks, and so
   the mode names involving <VAR

   mode names should generally be read as indicating the intention of
   the user to acquire row-level locks within the locked table.  Also,
   <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW EXCLUSIVE</VAR
> mode is a sharable table lock.  Keep in
   mind that all the lock modes have identical semantics so far as
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
> is concerned, differing only in the rules
   about which modes conflict with which.
