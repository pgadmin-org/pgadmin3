CLASS="COMMAND"

   if necessary for any conflicting locks to be released.  If
   <TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK
   TABLE</TT
> does not wait to acquire the desired lock: if it
   cannot be acquired immediately, the command is aborted and an
   error is emitted.  Once obtained, the lock is held for the
   remainder of the current transaction.  (There is no <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UNLOCK
   TABLE</TT
> command; locks are always released at transaction
   end.)
  </P
><P
>   When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference
   tables, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> always uses the least
   restrictive lock mode possible. <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
>
   provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking.
   For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the
   Read Committed isolation level and needs to ensure that data in a
   table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To
   achieve this you could obtain <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> lock mode over the
   table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes
   and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of
   committed data, because <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> lock mode conflicts with
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW EXCLUSIVE</TT
> lock acquired by writers, and your
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>name</I
></TT
> IN SHARE MODE</TT
>
   statement will wait until any concurrent holders of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</TT
> mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you
   obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding;
   furthermore none can begin until you release the lock.
  </P
><P
>   To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the Serializable
   isolation level, you have to execute the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK TABLE</TT
> statement
   before executing any <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> or data modification statement.
   A serializable transaction's view of data will be frozen when its first
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> or data modification statement begins.  A <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>LOCK
   TABLE</TT
> later in the transaction will still prevent concurrent writes
   &mdash; but it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to
   the latest committed values.
  </P
><P
>   If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the
   table, then it should use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</TT
> lock mode
   instead of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> mode.  This ensures that only one
   transaction of this type runs at a time.  Without this, a deadlock
   is possible: two transactions might both acquire <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
>
   mode, and then be unable to also acquire <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW EXCLUSIVE</TT
>
   mode to actually perform their updates.  (Note that a transaction's
   own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</TT
> mode when it holds <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> mode &mdash; but not
   if anyone else holds <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SHARE</TT
> mode.)  To avoid deadlocks,
   make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the
   same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single
   object, then transactions should always acquire the most
   restrictive mode first.

CLASS="COMMAND"

   mind that all the lock modes have identical semantics so far as
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

   about which modes conflict with which. For information on how to
   acquire an actual row-level lock, see <A
