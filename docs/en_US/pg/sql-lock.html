<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre class="synopsis">LOCK [ TABLE ] <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em> [, ...] [ IN <em class="replaceable"><code>lockmode</code></em> MODE ] [ NOWAIT ]

where <em class="replaceable"><code>lockmode</code></em> is one of:

    ACCESS SHARE | ROW SHARE | ROW EXCLUSIVE | SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
    | SHARE | SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE | EXCLUSIVE | ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</pre>

<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id709340"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> obtains a table-level lock, waiting
   if necessary for any conflicting locks to be released.  If
   <code class="literal">NOWAIT</code> is specified, <code class="command">LOCK
   TABLE</code> does not wait to acquire the desired lock: if it
   cannot be acquired immediately, the command is aborted and an
   error is emitted.  Once obtained, the lock is held for the
   remainder of the current transaction.  (There is no <code class="command">UNLOCK
   TABLE</code> command; locks are always released at transaction
   end.)
  </p>
<p>   When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference
   tables, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> always uses the least
   restrictive lock mode possible. <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code>
   provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking.
   For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the
   Read Committed isolation level and needs to ensure that data in a
   table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To
   achieve this you could obtain <code class="literal">SHARE</code> lock mode over the
   table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes
   and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of
   committed data, because <code class="literal">SHARE</code> lock mode conflicts with
   the <code class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</code> lock acquired by writers, and your
   <code class="command">LOCK TABLE <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em> IN SHARE MODE</code>
   statement will wait until any concurrent holders of <code class="literal">ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</code> mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you
   obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding;
   furthermore none can begin until you release the lock.
  </p>
<p>   To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the Serializable
   isolation level, you have to execute the <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> statement
   before executing any <code class="command">SELECT</code> or data modification statement.
   A serializable transaction's view of data will be frozen when its first
   <code class="command">SELECT</code> or data modification statement begins.  A <code class="command">LOCK
   TABLE</code> later in the transaction will still prevent concurrent writes
   [mdash ] but it won't ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to
   the latest committed values.
  </p>
<p>   If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the
   table, then it should use <code class="literal">SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</code> lock mode
   instead of <code class="literal">SHARE</code> mode.  This ensures that only one
   transaction of this type runs at a time.  Without this, a deadlock
   is possible: two transactions might both acquire <code class="literal">SHARE</code>
   mode, and then be unable to also acquire <code class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</code>
   mode to actually perform their updates.  (Note that a transaction's
   own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire <code class="literal">ROW
   EXCLUSIVE</code> mode when it holds <code class="literal">SHARE</code> mode [mdash ] but not
   if anyone else holds <code class="literal">SHARE</code> mode.)  To avoid deadlocks,
   make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the
   same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single
   object, then transactions should always acquire the most
   restrictive mode first.
  </p>
<p>   More information about the lock modes and locking strategies can be
   found in <a href="explicit-locking.html" title="12.3. Explicit Locking">Section 12.3, &#8220;Explicit Locking&#8221;</a>.

<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>      The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table to
      lock.
     </p>
<p>      The command <code class="literal">LOCK TABLE a, b;</code> is equivalent to
      <code class="literal">LOCK TABLE a; LOCK TABLE b;</code>. The tables are locked
      one-by-one in the order specified in the <code class="command">LOCK
      TABLE</code> command.
     </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>lockmode</code></em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>      The lock mode specifies which locks this lock conflicts with.
      Lock modes are described in <a href="explicit-locking.html" title="12.3. Explicit Locking">Section 12.3, &#8220;Explicit Locking&#8221;</a>.
     </p>
<p>      If no lock mode is specified, then <code class="literal">ACCESS
      EXCLUSIVE</code>, the most restrictive mode, is used.
     </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">NOWAIT</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>      Specifies that <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> should not wait for
      any conflicting locks to be released: if the specified lock(s)
      cannot be acquired immediately without waiting, the transaction
      is aborted.

<a name="id709656"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>    <code class="literal">LOCK TABLE ... IN ACCESS SHARE MODE</code> requires <code class="literal">SELECT</code>
    privileges on the target table.  All other forms of <code class="command">LOCK</code>
    require <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> and/or <code class="literal">DELETE</code> privileges.
   </p>
<p>    <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> is useful only inside a transaction
    block (<code class="command">BEGIN</code>/<code class="command">COMMIT</code> pair), since the lock
    is dropped as soon as the transaction ends.  A <code class="command">LOCK
    TABLE</code> command appearing outside any transaction block forms a
    self-contained transaction, so the lock will be dropped as soon as
    it is obtained.
   </p>
<p>   <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> only deals with table-level locks, and so
   the mode names involving <code class="literal">ROW</code> are all misnomers.  These
   mode names should generally be read as indicating the intention of
   the user to acquire row-level locks within the locked table.  Also,
   <code class="literal">ROW EXCLUSIVE</code> mode is a sharable table lock.  Keep in
   mind that all the lock modes have identical semantics so far as
   <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> is concerned, differing only in the rules
   about which modes conflict with which. For information on how to
   acquire an actual row-level lock, see <a href="explicit-locking.html#locking-rows" title="12.3.2. Row-Level Locks">Section 12.3.2, &#8220;Row-Level Locks&#8221;</a>
   and the <a href="sql-select.html#sql-for-update"><code class="literal">FOR UPDATE</code> Clause</a> in the <code class="command">SELECT</code>
   reference documentation.

<a name="id709796"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>   Obtain a <code class="literal">SHARE</code> lock on a primary key table when going to perform
   inserts into a foreign key table:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">BEGIN WORK;
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE MODE;
SELECT id FROM films 
    WHERE name = 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace';
-- Do ROLLBACK if record was not returned
INSERT INTO films_user_comments VALUES 
    (_id_, 'GREAT! I was waiting for it for so long!');
COMMIT WORK;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Take a <code class="literal">SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on a primary key table when going to perform
   a delete operation:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">BEGIN WORK;
LOCK TABLE films IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;
DELETE FROM films_user_comments WHERE id IN
    (SELECT id FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5);
DELETE FROM films WHERE rating &lt; 5;
COMMIT WORK;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id709844"></a><h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>   There is no <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> in the SQL standard,
   which instead uses <code class="command">SET TRANSACTION</code> to specify
   concurrency levels on transactions.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports that too;
   see <a href="sql-set-transaction.html">SET TRANSACTION</a> for details.
  </p>
<p>   Except for <code class="literal">ACCESS SHARE</code>, <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code>,
   and <code class="literal">SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</code> lock modes, the
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> lock modes and the
   <code class="command">LOCK TABLE</code> syntax are compatible with those
   present in <span class="productname">Oracle</span>.
