<a name="id2632310"></a><p>    Every function has a <i class="firstterm">volatility</i> classification, with
    the possibilities being <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt>, <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt>, or
    <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt>.  <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt> is the default if the
    <tt class="command">CREATE FUNCTION</tt> command does not specify a category.
    The volatility category is a promise to the optimizer about the behavior
    of the function:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      A <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt> function can do anything, including modifying
      the database.  It can return different results on successive calls with
      the same arguments.  The optimizer makes no assumptions about the
      behavior of such functions.  A query using a volatile function will
      re-evaluate the function at every row where its value is needed.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      A <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt> function cannot modify the database and is
      guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments
      for all calls within a single surrounding query.  This category
      allows the optimizer to optimize away multiple calls of the function
      within a single query.  In particular, it is safe to use an expression
      containing such a function in an indexscan condition.  (Since an
      indexscan will evaluate the comparison value only once, not once at
      each row, it is not valid to use a <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt> function in
      an indexscan condition.)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      An <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> function cannot modify the database and is
      guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments forever.
      This category allows the optimizer to pre-evaluate the function when
      a query calls it with constant arguments.  For example, a query like
      <tt class="literal">SELECT ... WHERE x = 2 + 2</tt> can be simplified on sight to
      <tt class="literal">SELECT ... WHERE x = 4</tt>, because the function underlying
      the integer addition operator is marked <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt>.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    For best optimization results, you should label your functions with the
    strictest volatility category that is valid for them.
   </p>
<p>    Any function with side-effects <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be labeled
    <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt>, so that calls to it cannot be optimized away.
    Even a function with no side-effects needs to be labeled
    <tt class="literal">VOLATILE</tt> if its value can change within a single query;
    some examples are <tt class="literal">random()</tt>, <tt class="literal">currval()</tt>,
    <tt class="literal">timeofday()</tt>.
   </p>
<p>    There is relatively little difference between <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> categories when considering simple interactive
    queries that are planned and immediately executed: it doesn't matter
    a lot whether a function is executed once during planning or once during
    query execution startup.  But there is a big difference if the plan is
    saved and reused later.  Labeling a function <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> when
    it really isn't may allow it to be prematurely folded to a constant during
    planning, resulting in a stale value being re-used during subsequent uses
    of the plan.  This is a hazard when using prepared statements or when
    using function languages that cache plans (such as
    <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>).
   </p>
<p>    Because of the snapshotting behavior of MVCC (see <a href="mvcc.html" title="Chapter 12. Concurrency Control">Chapter 12, <i>Concurrency Control</i></a>)
    a function containing only <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> commands can safely be
    marked <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt>, even if it selects from tables that might be
    undergoing modifications by concurrent queries.
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> will execute a <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt>
    function using the snapshot established for the calling query, and so it
    will see a fixed view of the database throughout that query.
    Also note
    that the <tt class="function">current_timestamp</tt> family of functions qualify
    as stable, since their values do not change within a transaction.
   </p>
<p>    The same snapshotting behavior is used for <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> commands
    within <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> functions.  It is generally unwise to select
    from database tables within an <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> function at all,
    since the immutability will be broken if the table contents ever change.
    However, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> does not enforce that you
    do not do that.
   </p>
<p>    A common error is to label a function <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> when its
    results depend on a configuration parameter.  For example, a function
    that manipulates timestamps might well have results that depend on the
    <a href="runtime-config.html#guc-timezone">timezone</a> setting.  For safety, such functions should
    be labeled <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt> instead.
   </p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>     Before <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> release 8.0, the requirement
     that <tt class="literal">STABLE</tt> and <tt class="literal">IMMUTABLE</tt> functions cannot modify
     the database was not enforced by the system.  Release 8.0 enforces it
     by requiring SQL functions and procedural language functions of these
     categories to contain no SQL commands other than <tt class="command">SELECT</tt>.
