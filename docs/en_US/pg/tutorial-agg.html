    Like  most  other relational database products, 
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports
    aggregate functions.
    An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows.
    For example, there are aggregates to compute the
    <tt class="function">count</tt>, <tt class="function">sum</tt>,
    <tt class="function">avg</tt> (average), <tt class="function">max</tt> (maximum) and
    <tt class="function">min</tt> (minimum) over a set of rows.
   </p>
<p>    As an example, we can find the highest low-temperature reading anywhere
    with

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather;</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="screen"> max
-----
  46
(1 row)</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    <a name="id2518712"></a>

    If we wanted to know what city (or cities) that reading occurred in,
    we might try

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);     <i class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">WRONG</span></i></pre>
<p>

    but this will not work since the aggregate
    <tt class="function">max</tt> cannot be used in the
    <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> clause.  (This restriction exists because
    the <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> clause determines the rows that will
    go into the aggregation stage; so it has to be evaluated before
    aggregate functions are computed.)
    However, as is often the case
    the query can be restated to accomplish the intended result, here
    by using a <i class="firstterm">subquery</i>:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city FROM weather
    WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="screen">     city
---------------
 San Francisco
(1 row)</pre>
<p>

    This is OK because the subquery is an independent computation
    that computes its own aggregate separately from what is happening
    in the outer query.
   </p>
<p>    <a name="id2518775"></a>
    <a name="id2518782"></a>

    Aggregates are also very useful in combination with <tt class="literal">GROUP
    BY</tt> clauses.  For example, we can get the maximum low
    temperature observed in each city with

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city;</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="screen">     city      | max
---------------+-----
 Hayward       |  37
 San Francisco |  46
(2 rows)</pre>
<p>

    which gives us one output row per city.  Each aggregate result is
    computed over the table rows matching that city.
    We can filter these grouped
    rows using <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt>:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING max(temp_lo) &lt; 40;</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="screen">  city   | max
---------+-----
 Hayward |  37
(1 row)</pre>
<p>

    which gives us the same results for only the cities that have all
    <tt class="literal">temp_lo</tt> values below 40.  Finally, if we only care about
    cities whose
    names begin with &#8220;<span class="quote"><tt class="literal">S</tt></span>&#8221;, we might do

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    WHERE city LIKE 'S%'<a name="co.tutorial-agg-like"></a>(1)
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING max(temp_lo) &lt; 40;</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<div class="calloutlist"><table border="0" summary="Callout list"><tr>
<td width="5%" valign="top" align="left">
<a href="#co.tutorial-agg-like">(1)</a> </td>
<td valign="top" align="left"><p>      The <tt class="literal">LIKE</tt> operator does pattern matching and
      is explained in <a href="functions-matching.html" title="9.7. Pattern Matching">Section 9.7, &#8220;Pattern Matching&#8221;</a>.
     </p></td>
</tr></table></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    It is important to understand the interaction between aggregates and
    <span class="acronym">SQL</span>'s <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> and <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt> clauses.
    The fundamental difference between <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt> is this: <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> selects
    input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls
    which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas
    <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt> selects group rows after groups and
    aggregates are computed.  Thus, the
    <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> clause must not contain aggregate functions;
    it makes no sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows
    will be inputs to the aggregates.  On the other hand,
    <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt> clause always contains aggregate functions.
    (Strictly speaking, you are allowed to write a <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt>
    clause that doesn't use aggregates, but it's wasteful: The same condition
    could be used more efficiently at the <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> stage.)
   </p>
<p>    Observe that we can apply the city name restriction in
    <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt>, since it needs no aggregate.  This is
    more efficient than adding the restriction to <tt class="literal">HAVING</tt>,
    because we avoid doing the grouping and aggregate calculations
    for all rows that fail the <tt class="literal">WHERE</tt> check.
