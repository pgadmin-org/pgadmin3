CLASS="LITERAL"
>ulimit -s</TT

        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety
        margin is needed because the stack depth is not checked in every
        routine in the server, but only in key potentially-recursive routines
        such as expression evaluation.  Setting the parameter higher than
        the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function
        can crash an individual backend process.  The default setting is
        2048 KB (two megabytes), which is conservatively small and unlikely
        to risk crashes.  However, it may be too small to allow execution
        of complex functions.

>      Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.0, there is a separate server
      process called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>background writer</I
>, whose sole function
      is to issue writes of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dirty"</SPAN
> shared buffers.  The intent is
      that server processes handling user queries should seldom or never have
      to wait for a write to occur, because the background writer will do it.
      This arrangement also reduces the performance penalty associated with
      checkpoints.  The background writer will continuously trickle out dirty
      pages to disk, so that only a few pages will need to be forced out when
      checkpoint time arrives, instead of the storm of dirty-buffer writes that
      formerly occurred at each checkpoint.  However there is a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because where a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      before have been written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times in the same interval.
      In most situations a continuous low load is preferable to periodic
      spikes, but the parameters discussed in this subsection can be used to tune
      the behavior for local needs.
