<a name="id2632943"></a><p>   As described in <a href="extend-type-system.html" title="31.2. The PostgreSQL Type System">Section 31.2, &#8220;The PostgreSQL Type System&#8221;</a>,
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> can be extended to support new
   data types.  This section describes how to define new base types,
   which are data types defined below the level of the <span class="acronym">SQL</span>
   language.  Creating a new base type requires implementing functions
   to operate on the type in a low-level language, usually C.
  </p>
<p>   The examples in this section can be found in
   <tt class="filename">complex.sql</tt> and <tt class="filename">complex.c</tt>
   in the <tt class="filename">src/tutorial</tt> directory of the source distribution.
   See the <tt class="filename">README</tt> file in that directory for instructions
   about running the examples.
  </p>
<p>  <a name="id2633008"></a>
  <a name="id2633015"></a>
  A user-defined type must always have input and output
  functions.<a name="id2633023"></a><a name="id2633032"></a>
  These functions determine how the type appears in strings (for input
  by the user and output to the user) and how the type is organized in
  memory.  The input function takes a null-terminated character string
  as its argument and returns the internal (in memory) representation
  of the type.  The output function takes the internal representation
  of the type as argument and returns a null-terminated character
  string.  If we want to do anything more with the type than merely
  store it, we must provide additional functions to implement whatever
  operations we'd like to have for the type.
 </p>
<p>  Suppose we want to define a type <tt class="type">complex</tt> that represents
  complex numbers. A natural way to represent a complex number in
  memory would be the following C structure:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">typedef struct Complex {
    double      x;
    double      y;
} Complex;</pre>
<p>

  We will need to make this a pass-by-reference type, since it's too
  large to fit into a single <tt class="type">Datum</tt> value.
 </p>
<p>  As the external string representation of the type, we choose a
  string of the form <tt class="literal">(x,y)</tt>.
 </p>
<p>  The input and output functions are usually not hard to write,
  especially the output function.  But when defining the external
  string representation of the type, remember that you must eventually
  write a complete and robust parser for that representation as your
  input function.  For instance:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_in);

Datum
complex_in(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    char       *str = PG_GETARG_CSTRING(0);
    double      x,
                y;
    Complex    *result;

    if (sscanf(str, " ( %lf , %lf )", &amp;x, &amp;y) != 2)
        ereport(ERROR,
                (errcode(ERRCODE_INVALID_TEXT_REPRESENTATION),
                 errmsg("invalid input syntax for complex: \"%s\"",
                        str)));

    result = (Complex *) palloc(sizeof(Complex));
    result-&gt;x = x;
    result-&gt;y = y;
    PG_RETURN_POINTER(result);
}</pre>
<p>

  The output function can simply be:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_out);

Datum
complex_out(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *complex = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    char       *result;

    result = (char *) palloc(100);
    snprintf(result, 100, "(%g,%g)", complex-&gt;x, complex-&gt;y);
    PG_RETURN_CSTRING(result);
}</pre>
<p>
 </p>
<p>  You should be careful to make the input and output functions inverses of
  each other.  If you do not, you will have severe problems when you
  need to dump your data into a file and then read it back in.  This
  is a particularly common problem when floating-point numbers are
  involved.
 </p>
<p>  Optionally, a user-defined type can provide binary input and output
  routines.  Binary I/O is normally faster but less portable than textual
  I/O.  As with textual I/O, it is up to you to define exactly what the
  external binary representation is.  Most of the built-in data types
  try to provide a machine-independent binary representation.  For
  <tt class="type">complex</tt>, we will piggy-back on the binary I/O converters
  for type <tt class="type">float8</tt>:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_recv);

Datum
complex_recv(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    StringInfo  buf = (StringInfo) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    Complex    *result;

    result = (Complex *) palloc(sizeof(Complex));
    result-&gt;x = pq_getmsgfloat8(buf);
    result-&gt;y = pq_getmsgfloat8(buf);
    PG_RETURN_POINTER(result);
}

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_send);

Datum
complex_send(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *complex = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    StringInfoData buf;

    pq_begintypsend(&amp;buf);
    pq_sendfloat8(&amp;buf, complex-&gt;x);
    pq_sendfloat8(&amp;buf, complex-&gt;y);
    PG_RETURN_BYTEA_P(pq_endtypsend(&amp;buf));
}</pre>
<p>
 </p>
<p>  To define the <tt class="type">complex</tt> type, we need to create the
  user-defined I/O functions before creating the type:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE FUNCTION complex_in(cstring)
    RETURNS complex
    AS '<i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i>'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_out(complex)
    RETURNS cstring
    AS '<i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i>'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_recv(internal)
   RETURNS complex
   AS '<i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i>'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_send(complex)
   RETURNS bytea
   AS '<i class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></i>'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;</pre>
<p>

  Notice that the declarations of the input and output functions must
  reference the not-yet-defined type.  This is allowed, but will draw
  warning messages that may be ignored.  The input function must
  appear first.
 </p>
<p>  Finally, we can declare the data type:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TYPE complex (
   internallength = 16, 
   input = complex_in,
   output = complex_out,
   receive = complex_recv,
   send = complex_send,
   alignment = double
);</pre>
<p>
 </p>
<p>  When you define a new base type,
  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> automatically provides support
  for arrays of that
  type.<a name="id2633244"></a> For historical reasons, the array type
  has the same name as the base type with the underscore character
  (<tt class="literal">_</tt>) prepended.
 </p>
<p>  Once the data type exists, we can declare additional functions to
  provide useful operations on the data type.  Operators can then be
  defined atop the functions, and if needed, operator classes can be
  created to support indexing of the data type.  These additional
  layers are discussed in following sections.
 </p>
<p>  If the values of your data type might exceed a few hundred bytes in
  size (in internal form), you should make the data type
  TOAST-able.<a name="id2633274"></a> To do this, the internal
  representation must follow the standard layout for variable-length
  data: the first four bytes must be an <tt class="type">int32</tt> containing
  the total length in bytes of the datum (including itself).  The C
  functions operating on the data type must be careful to unpack any
  toasted values they are handed (this detail can normally be hidden in the
  <tt class="function">GETARG</tt> macros).  Then,
  when running the <tt class="command">CREATE TYPE</tt> command, specify the
  internal length as <tt class="literal">variable</tt> and select the appropriate
  storage option.
 </p>

  <a href="sql-createtype.html">CREATE TYPE</a> command.
