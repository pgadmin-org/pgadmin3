     When you are defining a pair of commutative operators, things are
     a little trickier: how can the first one to be defined refer to the
     other one, which you haven't defined yet?  There are two solutions
     to this problem:

     <P

><LI
><P
>	One way is to omit the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</VAR

	you define, and then provide one in the second operator's definition.
	Since <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> knows that commutative
	operators come in pairs, when it sees the second definition it will
	automatically go back and fill in the missing <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</VAR
> clause in
	the first definition.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The other, more straightforward way is just to include <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</VAR
> clauses
	in both definitions.  When <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> processes
	the first definition and realizes that <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</VAR
> refers to a nonexistent
	operator, the system will make a dummy entry for that operator in the
	system catalog.  This dummy entry will have valid data only
	for the operator name, left and right operand types, and result type,
	since that's all that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> can deduce
	at this point.  The first operator's catalog entry will link to this
	dummy entry.  Later, when you define the second operator, the system
	updates the dummy entry with the additional information from the second
	definition.  If you try to use the dummy operator before it's been filled
	in, you'll just get an error message.

     exist yet.  But attempts to use the operator in hash joins will fail
     at runtime if no such operator class exists.  The system needs the
     operator class to find the data-type-specific hash function for the
     operator's input data type.  Of course, you must also supply a suitable
     hash function before you can create the operator class.
    </P
><P
>     Care should be exercised when preparing a hash function, because there
     are machine-dependent ways in which it might fail to do the right thing.
     For example, if your data type is a structure in which there may be
     uninteresting pad bits, you can't simply pass the whole structure to
     <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hash_any</CODE

     functions to ensure that the unused bits are always zero, which is the
     recommended strategy.)
     Another example is that on machines that meet the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IEEE</ACRONYM
>
     floating-point standard, negative zero and positive zero are different
     values (different bit patterns) but they are defined to compare equal.

     greater-than comparison between the two data types.  (These are actually
     four distinct operators if the merge-joinable operator has two different

	be transitive.
