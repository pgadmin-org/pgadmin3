><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Improve concurrent access to the shared buffer cache (Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>        Access to the shared buffer cache was identified as a
        significant scalability problem, particularly on multi-CPU
        systems. In this release, the way that locking is done in the
        buffer manager has been overhauled to reduce lock contention
        and improve scalability. The buffer manager has also been
        changed to use a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clock sweep"</SPAN
> replacement
        policy.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Allow index scans to use an intermediate in-memory bitmap (Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>        In previous releases, only a single index could be used to do
        lookups on a table. With this feature, if a query has
        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>WHERE tab.col1 = 4 and tab.col2 = 9</TT
>, and there is
        no multicolumn index on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
>,
        but there is an index on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and another on
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
>, it is possible to search both indexes and
        combine the results in memory, then do heap fetches for only
        the rows matching both the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col1</TT
> and
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col2</TT
> restrictions. This is very useful in
        environments that have a lot of unstructured queries where it
        is impossible to create indexes that match all possible access
        conditions.  Bitmap scans are useful even with a single index,
        as they reduce the amount of random access needed; a bitmap
        index scan is efficient for retrieving fairly large fractions
        of the complete table, whereas plain index scans are not.
       </P

><DT
>Add two-phase commit (Heikki Linnakangas, Alvaro, Tom)</DT
><DD
><P
>        Two-phase commit allows transactions to be "prepared" on several
        computers, and once all computers have successfully prepared
        their transactions (none failed), all transactions can be
        committed. Even if a machine crashes after a prepare, the
        prepared transaction can be committed after the machine is
        restarted. New syntax includes <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>PREPARE TRANSACTION</TT
> and
        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED</TT
>. A new system view
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_prepared_xacts</TT
> has also been added.

></DD
><DT
>Create a new role system that replaces users and groups 
       (Stephen Frost)</DT
><DD
><P
>        Roles are a combination of users and groups. Like users, they
        can have login capability, and like groups, a role can have
        other roles as members. Roles basically remove the distinction
        between users and groups. For example, a role can:
       </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>           Have login capability (optionally)
         </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          Own objects
         </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          Hold access permissions for database objects
         </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          Inherit permissions from other roles it is a member of
         </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>        Once a user logs into a role, she obtains capabilities of
        the login role plus any inherited roles, and can use
        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SET ROLE</TT
> to switch to other roles she is a member of.
        This feature is a generalization of the SQL standard's concept of
        roles.
        This change also replaces <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_shadow</TT
> and 
        <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_group</TT
> by new role-capable catalogs 
        <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_authid</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_auth_members</TT
>. The old
        tables are redefined as read-only views on the new role tables.

        <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>MIN()</CODE

><P
>        While <SPAN

        allows <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

> to never be blocked by writers and
        therefore does not need shared row locks for typical operations,
        shared locks are useful for applications that require shared row
        locking.  In particular this reduces the locking requirements
        imposed by referential integrity checks.

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

       because they are only four bytes long and the counter is shared
       across all installed databases. The preferred way of uniquely
       identifying rows is via sequences and the <TT

><P
>       Add <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
> syntax so eventually ordinary strings can
       treat backslashes literally (Bruce)
      </P
><P
>       Currently <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> processes a
       backslash in a string literal as introducing a special escape sequence,
       e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\n</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\010</TT
>.
       While this allows easy entry of special values, it is
       non-standard and makes porting of applications from other
       databases more difficult. For this reason, the
       <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> project is planning to
       remove the special meaning of backslashes in strings. For
       backward compatibility and for users who want special backslash
       processing, a new string syntax has been created. This new string
       syntax is formed by writing an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E</TT
> immediately preceding the
       single quote that starts the string, e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E'hi\n'</TT
>. While
       this release does not change the handling of backslashes in strings, it
       does add new configuration parameters to help users migrate applications
       for future releases:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>         <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standard_conforming_strings</TT
> &mdash; does this release
         treat backslashes literally in ordinary strings?
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>        <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>escape_string_warning</TT
> &mdash; warn about backslashes in
        ordinary (non-E) strings
       </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>       The <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standard_conforming_strings</TT
> value is read-only.
       Applications can retrieve the value to know how backslashes are
       processed.  (Presence of the parameter can also be taken as an
       indication that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
> string syntax is supported.)
       In a future release, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standard_conforming_strings</TT
>
       will be true, meaning backslashes will be treated literally in
       non-E strings. To prepare for this change, use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
>
       strings in places that need special backslash processing, and
       turn on <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>escape_string_warning</TT
> to find additional
       strings that need to be converted to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
>.
       Also, use two single-quotes (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>''</TT
>) to embed a literal
       single-quote in a string, rather than the
       <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>-supported syntax of
       backslash single-quote (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\'</TT
>).  The former is
       standards-conforming and does not require the use of the
       <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>E''</TT
> string syntax.  You can also use the
       <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$$</TT
> string syntax, which does not treat backslashes
       specially.
