><VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IN</VAR
>/<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NOT IN</VAR
> subqueries are
       now much more efficient</DT
><DD
><P
>        In previous releases, <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IN</VAR
>/<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NOT
        IN</VAR
> subqueries were joined to the upper query by
        sequentially scanning the subquery looking for a match.  The
        7.4 code uses the same sophisticated techniques used by
        ordinary joins and so is much faster.  An
        <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IN</VAR
> will now usually be as fast as or faster
        than an equivalent <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXISTS</VAR
> subquery; this
        reverses the conventional wisdom that applied to previous
        releases.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Improved <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>GROUP BY</VAR
> processing by using hash buckets</DT
><DD
><P
>        In previous releases, rows to be grouped had to be sorted
        first.  The 7.4 code can do <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>GROUP BY</VAR
>
        without sorting, by accumulating results into a hash table
        with one entry per group.  It will still use the sort
        technique, however, if the hash table is estimated to be too
        large to fit in <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"
>sort_mem</VAR
>.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>New multikey hash join capability</DT
><DD
><P
>        In previous releases, hash joins could only occur on single
        keys.  This release allows multicolumn hash joins.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Queries using the explicit <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</VAR
> syntax are
       now better optimized</DT
><DD
><P
>        Prior releases evaluated queries using the explicit
        <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</VAR
> syntax only in the order implied by
        the syntax. 7.4 allows full optimization of these queries,
        meaning the optimizer considers all possible join orderings
        and chooses the most efficient.  Outer joins, however, must
        still follow the declared ordering.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Faster and more powerful regular expression code</DT
><DD
><P
>        The entire regular expression module has been replaced with a
        new version by Henry Spencer, originally written for Tcl.  The
        code greatly improves performance and supports several flavors
        of regular expressions.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Function-inlining for simple SQL functions</DT
><DD
><P
>        Simple SQL functions can now be inlined by including their SQL
        in the main query.  This improves performance by eliminating
        per-call overhead.  That means simple SQL functions now
        behave like macros.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Full support for IPv6 connections and IPv6 address data types</DT
><DD
><P
>        Previous releases allowed only IPv4 connections, and the IP
        data types only supported IPv4 addresses. This release adds
        full IPv6 support in both of these areas.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Major improvements in SSL performance and reliability</DT
><DD
><P
>        Several people very familiar with the SSL API have overhauled
        our SSL code to improve SSL key negotiation and error
        recovery.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Make free space map efficiently reuse empty index pages,
       and other free space management improvements</DT
><DD
><P
>        In previous releases, B-tree index pages that were left empty
        because of deleted rows could only be reused by rows with
        index values similar to the rows originally indexed on that
        page. In 7.4, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> records empty index
        pages and allows them to be reused for any future index rows.

        recovery from <TT

></P><UL
><LI
><P
>       The server-side autocommit setting was removed and
       reimplemented in client applications and languages.
       Server-side autocommit was causing too many problems with
       languages and applications that wanted to control their own
       autocommit behavior, so autocommit was removed from the server
       and added to individual client APIs as appropriate.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Error message wording has changed substantially in this
       release.  Significant effort was invested to make the messages
       more consistent and user-oriented.  If your applications try to
       detect different error conditions by parsing the error message,
       you are strongly encouraged to use the new error code facility instead.

><P
>       Inner joins using the explicit <VAR

       the actual number of rows fetched/moved, or zero if at the

       the <VAR

       date in October even if <VAR
CLASS="VARNAME"

       as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>'now'</VAR
> or <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>'today'</VAR
> will
       no longer work as expected in column default expressions; they
       now cause the time of the table creation to be the default, not
       the time of the insertion.  Functions such as
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>now()</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>current_timestamp</CODE
>, or
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

      </P
><P
>       In previous releases, there was special code so that strings
       such as <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>'now'</VAR
> were interpreted at
       <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> time and not at table creation time, but
       this work around didn't cover all cases.  Release 7.4 now
       requires that defaults be defined properly using functions such
       as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>now()</CODE
> or <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>current_timestamp</CODE
>. These
       will work in all situations.

       operator names.  It can instead be a non-first character in
       identifiers.  This was done to improve compatibility with other
       database systems, and to avoid syntax problems when parameter
       placeholders (<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$<VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>n</VAR
></VAR

       adjacent to operators.
