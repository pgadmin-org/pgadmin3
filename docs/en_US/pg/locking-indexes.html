<a name="id2621398"></a><p>    Though <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
    provides nonblocking read/write access to table
    data, nonblocking read/write access is not currently offered for every
    index access method implemented
    in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.
    The various index types are handled as follows:

    </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">       B-tree and <acronym class="acronym">GiST</acronym> indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Short-term share/exclusive page-level locks are used for
        read/write access. Locks are released immediately after each
        index row is fetched or inserted.  These index types provide
        the highest concurrency without deadlock conditions.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Hash indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Share/exclusive hash-bucket-level locks are used for read/write
        access.  Locks are released after the whole bucket is processed.
        Bucket-level locks provide better concurrency than index-level
        ones, but deadlock is possible since the locks are held longer
        than one index operation.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       R-tree indexes
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Share/exclusive index-level locks are used for read/write access.
        Locks are released after the entire command is done.
       </p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Currently, B-tree indexes offer the best performance for concurrent
    applications; since they also have more features than hash
    indexes, they are the recommended index type for concurrent
    applications that need to index scalar data. When dealing with
    non-scalar data, B-trees are not useful, and GiST indexes should
    be used instead.  R-tree indexes are deprecated and are likely
    to disappear entirely in a future release.
