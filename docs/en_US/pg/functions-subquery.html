<pre class="synopsis">EXISTS ( <i class="replaceable"><tt>subquery</tt></i> )</pre>
<p>   The argument of <tt class="token">EXISTS</tt> is an arbitrary <tt class="command">SELECT</tt> statement,
   or <i class="firstterm">subquery</i>.  The
   subquery is evaluated to determine whether it returns any rows.
   If it returns at least one row, the result of <tt class="token">EXISTS</tt> is
   &#8220;<span class="quote">true</span>&#8221;; if the subquery returns no rows, the result of <tt class="token">EXISTS</tt> 
   is &#8220;<span class="quote">false</span>&#8221;.
  </p>
<p>   The subquery can refer to variables from the surrounding query,
   which will act as constants during any one evaluation of the subquery.
  </p>
<p>   The subquery will generally only be executed far enough to determine
   whether at least one row is returned, not all the way to completion.
   It is unwise to write a subquery that has any side effects (such as
   calling sequence functions); whether the side effects occur or not
   may be difficult to predict.
  </p>
<p>   Since the result depends only on whether any rows are returned,
   and not on the contents of those rows, the output list of the
   subquery is normally uninteresting.  A common coding convention is
   to write all <tt class="literal">EXISTS</tt> tests in the form
   <tt class="literal">EXISTS(SELECT 1 WHERE ...)</tt>.  There are exceptions to
   this rule however, such as subqueries that use <tt class="token">INTERSECT</tt>.
  </p>
<p>   This simple example is like an inner join on <tt class="literal">col2</tt>, but
   it produces at most one output row for each <tt class="literal">tab1</tt> row,
   even if there are multiple matching <tt class="literal">tab2</tt> rows:
</p>
<pre class="screen">SELECT col1 FROM tab1
    WHERE EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM tab2 WHERE col2 = tab1.col2);</pre>

<pre class="synopsis"><i class="replaceable"><tt>expression</tt></i> IN (<i class="replaceable"><tt>subquery</tt></i>)</pre>
<p>   The right-hand side is a parenthesized
   subquery, which must return exactly one column.  The left-hand expression
   is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result.
   The result of <tt class="token">IN</tt> is &#8220;<span class="quote">true</span>&#8221; if any equal subquery row is found.
   The result is &#8220;<span class="quote">false</span>&#8221; if no equal row is found (including the special
   case where the subquery returns no rows).
  </p>
<p>   Note that if the left-hand expression yields null, or if there are
   no equal right-hand values and at least one right-hand row yields
   null, the result of the <tt class="token">IN</tt> construct will be null, not false.
   This is in accordance with SQL's normal rules for Boolean combinations
   of null values.

<p>   The left-hand side of this form of <tt class="token">IN</tt> is a row constructor,
   as described in <a href="sql-expressions.html#sql-syntax-row-constructors" title="4.2.11. Row Constructors">Section 4.2.11, &#8220;Row Constructors&#8221;</a>.
   The right-hand side is a parenthesized
   subquery, which must return exactly as many columns as there are
   expressions in the left-hand row.  The left-hand expressions are
   evaluated and compared row-wise to each row of the subquery result.

   The result is &#8220;<span class="quote">false</span>&#8221; if no equal row is found (including the special
   case where the subquery returns no rows).
  </p>
<p>   As usual, null values in the rows are combined per
   the normal rules of SQL Boolean expressions.  Two rows are considered
   equal if all their corresponding members are non-null and equal; the rows
   are unequal if any corresponding members are non-null and unequal;
   otherwise the result of that row comparison is unknown (null).
   If all the row results are either unequal or null, with at least one null,
   then the result of <tt class="token">IN</tt> is null.
