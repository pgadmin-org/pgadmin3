<p>   This chapter defines the interface between the core
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> system and <em class="firstterm">index access
   methods</em>, which manage individual index types.  The core system
   knows nothing about indexes beyond what is specified here, so it is
   possible to develop entirely new index types by writing add-on code.
  </p>
<p>   All indexes in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> are what are known
   technically as <em class="firstterm">secondary indexes</em>; that is, the index is
   physically separate from the table file that it describes.  Each index
   is stored as its own physical <em class="firstterm">relation</em> and so is described
   by an entry in the <code class="structname">pg_class</code> catalog.  The contents of an
   index are entirely under the control of its index access method.  In
   practice, all index access methods divide indexes into standard-size
   pages so that they can use the regular storage manager and buffer manager
   to access the index contents.  (All the existing index access methods
   furthermore use the standard page layout described in <a href="storage-page-layout.html" title="50.3. Database Page Layout">Section 50.3, &#8220;Database Page Layout&#8221;</a>, and they all use the same format for index
   tuple headers; but these decisions are not forced on an access method.)
  </p>
<p>   An index is effectively a mapping from some data key values to
   <em class="firstterm">tuple identifiers</em>, or <acronym class="acronym">TIDs</acronym>, of row versions
   (tuples) in the index's parent table.  A TID consists of a
   block number and an item number within that block (see <a href="storage-page-layout.html" title="50.3. Database Page Layout">Section 50.3, &#8220;Database Page Layout&#8221;</a>).  This is sufficient
   information to fetch a particular row version from the table.
   Indexes are not directly aware that under MVCC, there may be multiple
   extant versions of the same logical row; to an index, each tuple is
   an independent object that needs its own index entry.  Thus, an
   update of a row always creates all-new index entries for the row, even if
   the key values did not change.  Index entries for dead tuples are
   reclaimed (by vacuuming) when the dead tuples themselves are reclaimed.

<a name="index-catalog"></a>48.1. Catalog Entries for Indexes</h2></div></div></div>
<p>   Each index access method is described by a row in the
   <code class="structname">pg_am</code> system catalog (see
   <a href="catalog-pg-am.html" title="42.3. pg_am">Section 42.3, &#8220;<code class="structname">pg_am</code>&#8221;</a>).  The principal contents of a
   <code class="structname">pg_am</code> row are references to
   <a href="catalog-pg-proc.html" title="42.27. pg_proc"><code class="structname">pg_proc</code></a>
   entries that identify the index access
   functions supplied by the access method.  The APIs for these functions
   are defined later in this chapter.  In addition, the
   <code class="structname">pg_am</code> row specifies a few fixed properties of
   the access method, such as whether it can support multicolumn indexes.
   There is not currently any special support
   for creating or deleting <code class="structname">pg_am</code> entries;
   anyone able to write a new access method is expected to be competent
   to insert an appropriate row for themselves.
  </p>
<p>   To be useful, an index access method must also have one or more
   <em class="firstterm">operator classes</em> defined in
   <a href="catalog-pg-opclass.html" title="42.24. pg_opclass"><code class="structname">pg_opclass</code></a>,
   <a href="catalog-pg-amop.html" title="42.4. pg_amop"><code class="structname">pg_amop</code></a>, and
   <a href="catalog-pg-amproc.html" title="42.5. pg_amproc"><code class="structname">pg_amproc</code></a>.
   These entries allow the planner
   to determine what kinds of query qualifications can be used with
   indexes of this access method.  Operator classes are described
   in <a href="xindex.html" title="32.14. Interfacing Extensions To Indexes">Section 32.14, &#8220;Interfacing Extensions To Indexes&#8221;</a>, which is prerequisite material for reading
   this chapter.
  </p>
<p>   An individual index is defined by a 
   <a href="catalog-pg-class.html" title="42.12. pg_class"><code class="structname">pg_class</code></a>
   entry that describes it as a physical relation, plus a
   <a href="catalog-pg-index.html" title="42.18. pg_index"><code class="structname">pg_index</code></a>
   entry that shows the logical content of the index [mdash ] that is, the set
   of index columns it has and the semantics of those columns, as captured by
   the associated operator classes.  The index columns (key values) can be
   either simple columns of the underlying table or expressions over the table
   rows.  The index access method normally has no interest in where the index
   key values come from (it is always handed precomputed key values) but it
   will be very interested in the operator class information in
   <code class="structname">pg_index</code>.  Both of these catalog entries can be
   accessed as part of the <code class="structname">Relation</code> data structure that is
   passed to all operations on the index.
  </p>
<p>   Some of the flag columns of <code class="structname">pg_am</code> have nonobvious
   implications.  The requirements of <code class="structfield">amcanunique</code>
   are discussed in <a href="index-unique-checks.html" title="48.5. Index Uniqueness Checks">Section 48.5, &#8220;Index Uniqueness Checks&#8221;</a>, and those of
   <code class="structfield">amconcurrent</code> in <a href="index-locking.html" title="48.4. Index Locking Considerations">Section 48.4, &#8220;Index Locking Considerations&#8221;</a>.
   The <code class="structfield">amcanmulticol</code> flag asserts that the
   access method supports multicolumn indexes, while
   <code class="structfield">amoptionalkey</code> asserts that it allows scans
   where no indexable restriction clause is given for the first index column.
   When <code class="structfield">amcanmulticol</code> is false,
   <code class="structfield">amoptionalkey</code> essentially says whether the
   access method allows full-index scans without any restriction clause.
   Access methods that support multiple index columns <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
   support scans that omit restrictions on any or all of the columns after
   the first; however they are permitted to require some restriction to
   appear for the first index column, and this is signaled by setting
   <code class="structfield">amoptionalkey</code> false.
   <code class="structfield">amindexnulls</code> asserts that index entries are
   created for NULL key values.  Since most indexable operators are
   strict and hence cannot return TRUE for NULL inputs,
   it is at first sight attractive to not store index entries for null values:
   they could never be returned by an index scan anyway.  However, this
   argument fails when an index scan has no restriction clause for a given
   index column.  In practice this means that
   indexes that have <code class="structfield">amoptionalkey</code> true must
   index nulls, since the planner might decide to use such an index
   with no scan keys at all.  A related restriction is that an index
   access method that supports multiple index columns <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
   support indexing null values in columns after the first, because the planner
   will assume the index can be used for queries that do not restrict
   these columns.  For example, consider an index on (a,b) and a query with
   <code class="literal">WHERE a = 4</code>.  The system will assume the index can be
   used to scan for rows with <code class="literal">a = 4</code>, which is wrong if the
   index omits rows where <code class="literal">b</code> is null.
   It is, however, OK to omit rows where the first indexed column is null.
   (GiST currently does so.)  Thus,
   <code class="structfield">amindexnulls</code> should be set true only if the
   index access method indexes all rows, including arbitrary combinations of
   null values.
