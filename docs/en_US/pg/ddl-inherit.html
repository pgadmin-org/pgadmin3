<a name="id2572530"></a><a name="id2572535"></a><p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> implements table inheritance,
   which can be a useful tool for database designers.  (SQL:1999 and
   later define a type inheritance feature, which differs in many
   respects from the features described here.)
  </p>
<p>   Let's start with an example: suppose we are trying to build a data
   model for cities.  Each state has many cities, but only one
   capital. We want to be able to quickly retrieve the capital city
   for any particular state. This can be done by creating two tables,
   one for state capitals and one for cities that are not
   capitals. However, what happens when we want to ask for data about
   a city, regardless of whether it is a capital or not? The
   inheritance feature can help to resolve this problem. We define the
   <code class="structname">capitals</code> table so that it inherits from
   <code class="structname">cities</code>:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE cities (
    name            text,
    population      float,
    altitude        int     -- in feet
);

CREATE TABLE capitals (
    state           char(2)
) INHERITS (cities);</pre>
<p>

   In this case, the <code class="structname">capitals</code> table <em class="firstterm">inherits</em>
   all the columns of its parent table, <code class="structname">cities</code>. State
   capitals also have an extra column, <code class="structfield">state</code>, that shows
   their state.
  </p>
<p>   In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, a table can inherit from
   zero or more other tables, and a query can reference either all
   rows of a table or all rows of a table plus all of its descendant tables.
   The latter behavior is the default.
   For example, the following query finds the names of all cities,
   including state capitals, that are located at an altitude over
   500ft:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT name, altitude
    FROM cities
    WHERE altitude &gt; 500;</pre>
<p>

   Given the sample data from the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
   tutorial (see <a href="tutorial-sql.html#tutorial-sql-intro" title="2.1. Introduction">Section 2.1, &#8220;Introduction&#8221;</a>), this returns:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">   name    | altitude
-----------+----------
 Las Vegas |     2174
 Mariposa  |     1953
 Madison   |      845</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   On the other hand, the following query finds all the cities that
   are not state capitals and are situated at an altitude over 500ft:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT name, altitude
    FROM ONLY cities
    WHERE altitude &gt; 500;

   name    | altitude
-----------+----------
 Las Vegas |     2174
 Mariposa  |     1953</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Here the <code class="literal">ONLY</code> keyword indicates that the query
   should apply only to <code class="structname">cities</code>, and not any tables
   below <code class="structname">cities</code> in the inheritance hierarchy.  Many
   of the commands that we have already discussed &#8212;
   <code class="command">SELECT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and
   <code class="command">DELETE</code> &#8212; support the
   <code class="literal">ONLY</code> keyword.
  </p>
<p>   In some cases you may wish to know which table a particular row
   originated from. There is a system column called
   <code class="structfield">tableoid</code> in each table which can tell you the
   originating table:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT c.tableoid, c.name, c.altitude
FROM cities c
WHERE c.altitude &gt; 500;</pre>
<p>

   which returns:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting"> tableoid |   name    | altitude
----------+-----------+----------
   139793 | Las Vegas |     2174
   139793 | Mariposa  |     1953
   139798 | Madison   |      845</pre>
<p>

   (If you try to reproduce this example, you will probably get
   different numeric OIDs.)  By doing a join with
   <code class="structname">pg_class</code> you can see the actual table names:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT p.relname, c.name, c.altitude
FROM cities c, pg_class p
WHERE c.altitude &gt; 500 and c.tableoid = p.oid;</pre>
<p>

   which returns:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting"> relname  |   name    | altitude
----------+-----------+----------
 cities   | Las Vegas |     2174
 cities   | Mariposa  |     1953
 capitals | Madison   |      845</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Inheritance does not automatically propagate data from
   <code class="command">INSERT</code> or <code class="command">COPY</code> commands to
   other tables in the inheritance hierarchy. In our example, the
   following <code class="command">INSERT</code> statement will fail:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO cities (name, population, altitude, state)
VALUES ('New York', NULL, NULL, 'NY');</pre>
<p>
   We might hope that the data would somehow be routed to the
   <code class="structname">capitals</code> table, but this does not happen:
   <code class="command">INSERT</code> always inserts into exactly the table
   specified.  In some cases it is possible to redirect the insertion
   using a rule (see <a href="rules.html" title="Chapter 35. The Rule System">Chapter 35, <i>The Rule System</i></a>).  However that does not
   help for the above case because the <code class="structname">cities</code> table
   does not contain the column <code class="structfield">state</code>, and so the
   command will be rejected before the rule can be applied.
  </p>
<p>   All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are
   automatically inherited by its children.  Other types of constraints
   (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.
  </p>
<p>   A table can inherit from more than one parent table, in which case it has
   the union of the columns defined by the parent tables.  Any columns
   declared in the child table's definition are added to these.  If the
   same column name appears in multiple parent tables, or in both a parent
   table and the child's definition, then these columns are &#8220;<span class="quote">merged</span>&#8221;
   so that there is only one such column in the child table.  To be merged,
   columns must have the same data types, else an error is raised.  The
   merged column will have copies of all the check constraints coming from
   any one of the column definitions it came from, and will be marked not-null
   if any of them are.
  </p>
<p>   Table inheritance is typically established when the child table is
   created, using the <code class="literal">INHERITS</code> clause of the
   <a href="sql-createtable.html" title="CREATE TABLE">CREATE TABLE</a>
   statement.
   Alternatively, a table which is already defined in a compatible way can
   have a new parent relationship added, using the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code>
   variant of <a href="sql-altertable.html" title="ALTER TABLE">ALTER TABLE</a>.
   To do this the new child table must already include columns with
   the same names and types as the columns of the parent. It must also include
   check constraints with the same names and check expressions as those of the
   parent. Similarly an inheritance link can be removed from a child using the
   <code class="literal">NO INHERIT</code> variant of <code class="command">ALTER TABLE</code>.
   Dynamically adding and removing inheritance links like this can be useful
   when the inheritance relationship is being used for table
   partitioning (see <a href="ddl-partitioning.html" title="5.9. Partitioning">Section 5.9, &#8220;Partitioning&#8221;</a>).
  </p>
<p>   One convenient way to create a compatible table that will later be made
   a new child is to use the <code class="literal">LIKE</code> clause in <code class="command">CREATE
   TABLE</code>. This creates a new table with the same columns as
   the source table. If there are any <code class="literal">CHECK</code>
   constraints defined on the source table, the <code class="literal">INCLUDING
   CONSTRAINTS</code> option to <code class="literal">LIKE</code> should be
   specified, as the new child must have constraints matching the parent
   to be considered compatible.
  </p>
<p>   A parent table cannot be dropped while any of its children remain. Neither
   can columns of child tables be dropped or altered if they are inherited
   from any parent tables. If you wish to remove a table and all of its
   descendants, one easy way is to drop the parent table with the
   <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> option.
  </p>
<p>   <a href="sql-altertable.html" title="ALTER TABLE">ALTER TABLE</a> will
   propagate any changes in column data definitions and check
   constraints down the inheritance hierarchy.  Again, dropping
   columns or constraints on parent tables is only possible when using
   the <code class="literal">CASCADE</code> option. <code class="command">ALTER
   TABLE</code> follows the same rules for duplicate column merging
   and rejection that apply during <code class="command">CREATE TABLE</code>.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ddl-inherit-caveats"></a>5.8.1. Caveats</h3></div></div></div>
<p>   Table access permissions are not automatically inherited.  Therefore,
   a user attempting to access a parent table must either have permissions
   to do the operation on all its child tables as well, or must use the
   <code class="literal">ONLY</code> notation.  When adding a new child table to
   an existing inheritance hierarchy, be careful to grant all the needed
   permissions on it.
  </p>
<p>   A serious limitation of the inheritance feature is that indexes (including
   unique constraints) and foreign key constraints only apply to single
   tables, not to their inheritance children. This is true on both the
   referencing and referenced sides of a foreign key constraint. Thus,
   in the terms of the above example:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      If we declared <code class="structname">cities</code>.<code class="structfield">name</code> to be
      <code class="literal">UNIQUE</code> or a <code class="literal">PRIMARY KEY</code>, this would not stop the
      <code class="structname">capitals</code> table from having rows with names duplicating
      rows in <code class="structname">cities</code>.  And those duplicate rows would by
      default show up in queries from <code class="structname">cities</code>.  In fact, by
      default <code class="structname">capitals</code> would have no unique constraint at all,
      and so could contain multiple rows with the same name.
      You could add a unique constraint to <code class="structname">capitals</code>, but this
      would not prevent duplication compared to <code class="structname">cities</code>.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Similarly, if we were to specify that
      <code class="structname">cities</code>.<code class="structfield">name</code> <code class="literal">REFERENCES</code> some
      other table, this constraint would not automatically propagate to
      <code class="structname">capitals</code>.  In this case you could work around it by
      manually adding the same <code class="literal">REFERENCES</code> constraint to
      <code class="structname">capitals</code>.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Specifying that another table's column <code class="literal">REFERENCES
      cities(name)</code> would allow the other table to contain city names, but
      not capital names.  There is no good workaround for this case.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

   These deficiencies will probably be fixed in some future release,
   but in the meantime considerable care is needed in deciding whether
   inheritance is useful for your problem.

<h3 class="title">Deprecated</h3>
<p>     In releases of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> prior to 7.1, the
     default behavior was not to include child tables in queries. This was
     found to be error prone and also in violation of the SQL
     standard.  You can get the pre-7.1 behavior by turning off the
     <a href="runtime-config-compatible.html#guc-sql-inheritance">sql_inheritance</a> configuration
     option.
