<a name="id2556105"></a><p>    Thus far, our queries have only accessed one table at a time.
    Queries can access multiple tables at once, or access the same
    table in such a way that multiple rows of the table are being
    processed at the same time.  A query that accesses multiple rows
    of the same or different tables at one time is called a
    <em class="firstterm">join</em> query.  As an example, say you wish to
    list all the weather records together with the location of the
    associated city.  To do that, we need to compare the city column of
    each row of the weather table with the name column of all rows in
    the cities table, and select the pairs of rows where these values match.
    </p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>      This  is only a conceptual model.  The join is usually performed
      in a more efficient manner than actually comparing each possible
      pair of rows, but this is invisible to the user.
     </p>
</div>
<p>
    This would be accomplished by the following query:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT *
    FROM weather, cities
    WHERE city = name;</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre class="screen">     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
(2 rows)</pre>
<p>

   </p>
<p>    Observe two things about the result set:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>       There is no result row for the city of Hayward.  This is
       because there is no matching entry in the
       <code class="classname">cities</code> table for Hayward, so the join
       ignores the unmatched rows in the weather table.  We will see
       shortly how this can be fixed.
      </p></li>
<li>
<p>       There are two columns containing the city name.  This is
       correct because the lists of columns of the
       <code class="classname">weather</code> and the
       <code class="classname">cities</code> table are concatenated.  In
       practice this is undesirable, though, so you will probably want
       to list the output columns explicitly rather than using
       <code class="literal">*</code>:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
    FROM weather, cities
    WHERE city = name;</pre>
<p>
      </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
   </p>
<p><b>Exercise: </b>     Attempt to find out the semantics of this query when the
     <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause is omitted.
    </p>
<p>    Since the columns all had different names, the parser
    automatically found out which table they belong to, but it is good
    style to fully qualify column names in join queries:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi,
       weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.location
    FROM weather, cities
    WHERE cities.name = weather.city;</pre>
<p>
   </p>
<p>    Join queries of the kind seen thus far can also be written in this
    alternative form:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT *
    FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);</pre>
<p>

    This syntax is not as commonly used as the one above, but we show
    it here to help you understand the following topics.
   </p>
<p>    <a name="id2556251"></a>

    Now we will figure out how we can get the Hayward records back in.
    What we want the query to do is to scan the
    <code class="classname">weather</code> table and for each row to find the
    matching <code class="classname">cities</code> row.  If no matching row is
    found we want some &#8220;<span class="quote">empty values</span>&#8221; to be substituted
    for the <code class="classname">cities</code> table's columns.  This kind
    of query is called an <em class="firstterm">outer join</em>.  (The
    joins we have seen so far are inner joins.)  The command looks
    like this:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT *
    FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);

     city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
 Hayward       |      37 |      54 |      | 1994-11-29 |               |
 San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
 San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
(3 rows)</pre>
<p>

    This query is called a <em class="firstterm">left outer
    join</em> because the table mentioned on the left of the
    join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least
    once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows
    output that match some row of the left table.  When outputting a
    left-table row for which there is no right-table match, empty (null)
    values are substituted for the right-table columns.
   </p>
<p><b>Exercise: </b>     There are also right outer joins and full outer joins.  Try to
     find out what those do.
    </p>
<p>    <a name="id2556320"></a>
    <a name="id2556329"></a>

    We can also join a table against itself.  This is called a
    <em class="firstterm">self join</em>.  As an example, suppose we wish
    to find all the weather records that are in the temperature range
    of other weather records.  So we need to compare the
    <code class="structfield">temp_lo</code> and <code class="structfield">temp_hi</code> columns of
    each <code class="classname">weather</code> row to the
    <code class="structfield">temp_lo</code> and
    <code class="structfield">temp_hi</code> columns of all other
    <code class="classname">weather</code> rows.  We can do this with the
    following query:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT W1.city, W1.temp_lo AS low, W1.temp_hi AS high,
    W2.city, W2.temp_lo AS low, W2.temp_hi AS high
    FROM weather W1, weather W2
    WHERE W1.temp_lo &lt; W2.temp_lo
    AND W1.temp_hi &gt; W2.temp_hi;

     city      | low | high |     city      | low | high
---------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------
 San Francisco |  43 |   57 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
 Hayward       |  37 |   54 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
(2 rows)</pre>
<p>     

    Here we have relabeled the weather table as <code class="literal">W1</code> and
    <code class="literal">W2</code> to be able to distinguish the left and right side
    of the join.  You can also use these kinds of aliases in other
    queries to save some typing, e.g.:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">SELECT *
    FROM weather w, cities c
    WHERE w.city = c.name;</pre>
<p>
    You will encounter this style of abbreviating quite frequently.
