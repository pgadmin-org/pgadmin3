>     If you run the tests against an already-installed server that was
     initialized with a collation order locale different than C then
     there may be differences due to sort order and follow-up
     failures.  The regression test suite is set up to handle this
     problem by providing alternative result files that together are
     known to handle a large number of locales.  For example, for the
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"char"</SPAN
> test, the expected file
     <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>char.out</TT
> handles the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSIX</TT
> locales,
     and the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>char_1.out</TT
> handles many other
     locales.  The regression test driver will automatically pick the
     best file to match against when checking for success and for
     computing failure differences.  (This means that the regression
     tests cannot detect whether the results are appropriate for the
     configured locale.  The tests will simply pick the one result
     file that works best.)
    </P
><P

>testname</I

>_<TT

>digit</I

     The actual digit is not significant.  Remember that the
     regression test driver will consider all such files to be equally
     valid test results.  If the test results are platform-dependent,
     the technique described in <A

     fail if you run the test on the day of a daylight-saving time
     changeover, or the day before or after one.  These queries assume
     that the intervals between midnight yesterday, midnight today and
     midnight tomorrow are exactly twenty-four hours -- which is wrong
     if daylight-saving time went into or out of effect meanwhile.

     failures if the tests are not run with that time zone setting.
     The regression test driver sets environment variable
     <TT

>PGTZ</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>PST8PDT</TT

     ensures proper results.  However, your system must provide library
     support for the <TT

     tests will fail. To verify that your machine does have this
     support, type the following:

CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>$ </TT
><TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>env TZ=PST8PDT date</B

     The command above should have returned the current system time in
     the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"
>PST8PDT</TT
> database is not available,
     then your system may have returned the time in GMT. If the
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PST8PDT</TT
> time zone is not available, you can set the time zone
     rules explicitly:
</P><PRE

><P>
    </P
><P
>     There appear to be some systems that do not accept the
     recommended syntax for explicitly setting the local time zone
     rules; you may need to use a different <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGTZ</TT
>
     setting on such machines.
    </P
><P
>     Some systems using older time zone libraries fail to apply
     daylight-saving corrections to dates before 1970, causing
     pre-1970 <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

CLASS="ACRONYM"

     result in localized differences in the test results.

><P
>You might see differences in which the same rows are output in a
different order than what appears in the expected file.  In most cases
this is not, strictly speaking, a bug.  Most of the regression test
scripts are not so pedantic as to use an ORDER BY for every single
SELECT, and so their result row orderings are not well-defined
according to the letter of the SQL specification.  In practice, since we are
looking at the same queries being executed on the same data by the same
software, we usually get the same result ordering on all platforms, and
so the lack of ORDER BY isn't a problem.  Some queries do exhibit
cross-platform ordering differences, however.  (Ordering differences
can also be triggered by non-C locale settings.)
    </P
><P
>Therefore, if you see an ordering difference, it's not something to
worry about, unless the query does have an ORDER BY that your result
is violating.  But please report it anyway, so that we can add an
ORDER BY to that particular query and thereby eliminate the bogus
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"failure"</SPAN
> in future releases.
    </P
><P
>You might wonder why we don't order all the regress test queries explicitly to
get rid of this issue once and for all.  The reason is that that would
make the regression tests less useful, not more, since they'd tend
to exercise query plan types that produce ordered results to the
exclusion of those that don't.
