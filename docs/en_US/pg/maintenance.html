   a regular basis to keep a <SPAN

   server running smoothly.  The tasks discussed here are repetitive
   in nature and can easily be automated using standard Unix tools such
   as <SPAN

   administrator's responsibility to set up appropriate scripts, and to
   check that they execute successfully.
  </P
><P
>   One obvious maintenance task is creation of backup copies of the data on a
   regular schedule.  Without a recent backup, you have no chance of recovery
   after a catastrophe (disk failure, fire, mistakenly dropping a critical
   table, etc.).  The backup and recovery mechanisms available in
   <SPAN

   <A

  </P

   of the database.  This activity is discussed in
   <A

  </P

  </P

   The frequency and scope of the <TT

   Therefore, database administrators must understand these issues and
   develop an appropriate maintenance strategy.  This section concentrates
   on explaining the high-level issues; for details about command syntax
   and so on, see the <TT

   (selects, inserts, updates, deletes, but not changes to table definitions).
   Routine vacuuming is therefore not nearly as intrusive as it was in prior
   releases, and it's not as critical to try to schedule it at low-usage
   times of day.

    immediately remove the old <I

    This approach is necessary to gain the benefits of multiversion
    concurrency control (see <A
HREF="mvcc.html"
>Chapter 12</A
>): the tuple
    must not be deleted while it is still potentially visible to other
    transactions. But eventually, an outdated or deleted tuple is no
    longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must be
    reclaimed for reuse by new tuples, to avoid infinite growth of disk
    space requirements. This is done by running <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    Clearly, a table that receives frequent updates or deletes will need
    to be vacuumed more often than tables that are seldom updated. It
    may be useful to set up periodic <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>cron</SPAN
> tasks that
    vacuum only selected tables, skipping tables that are known not to
    change often. This is only likely to be helpful if you have both
    large heavily-updated tables and large seldom-updated tables --- the
    extra cost of vacuuming a small table isn't enough to be worth
    worrying about.
   </P
><P
>    The standard form of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> is best used with the goal of
    maintaining a fairly level steady-state usage of disk space.  The standard
    form finds old tuples and makes their space available for re-use within
    the table, but it does not try very hard to shorten the table file and
    return disk space to the operating system.  If you need to return disk
    space to the operating system you can use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> ---
    but what's the point of releasing disk space that will only have to be
    allocated again soon?  Moderately frequent standard <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> runs
    are a better approach than infrequent <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> runs for
    maintaining heavily-updated tables.
   </P
><P
>    Recommended practice for most sites is to schedule a database-wide
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> once a day at a low-usage time of day, supplemented
    by more frequent vacuuming of heavily-updated tables if necessary.
    (If you have multiple databases in a cluster, don't forget to
    vacuum each one; the program <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vacuumdb</TT
> may be helpful.)
    Use plain <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>, not <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
>, for routine
    vacuuming for space recovery.
   </P
><P
>    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT

    deleted the majority of tuples in a table, so that the steady-state size
    of the table can be shrunk substantially with <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
>'s
    more aggressive approach.

>    The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    statistical information about the contents of tables in order to
    generate good plans for queries.  These statistics are gathered by
    the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> command, which can be invoked by itself or
    as an optional step in <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>.  It is important to have
    reasonably accurate statistics, otherwise poor choices of plans may
    degrade database performance.
   </P
><P
>    As with vacuuming for space recovery, frequent updates of statistics
    are more useful for heavily-updated tables than for seldom-updated
    ones. But even for a heavily-updated table, there may be no need for
    statistics updates if the statistical distribution of the data is
    not changing much. A simple rule of thumb is to think about how much
    the minimum and maximum values of the columns in the table change.
    For example, a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> column that contains the time
    of row update will have a constantly-increasing maximum value as
    rows are added and updated; such a column will probably need more
    frequent statistics updates than, say, a column containing URLs for
    pages accessed on a website. The URL column may receive changes just
    as often, but the statistical distribution of its values probably
    changes relatively slowly.
   </P
><P
>    It is possible to run <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> on specific tables and even
    just specific columns of a table, so the flexibility exists to update some
    statistics more frequently than others if your application requires it.
    In practice, however, the usefulness of this feature is doubtful.
    Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 7.2,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> is a fairly fast operation even on large tables,
    because it uses a statistical random sampling of the rows of a table
    rather than reading every single row.  So it's probably much simpler
    to just run it over the whole database every so often.

>    <SPAN

    numbers: a tuple with an insertion XID greater than the current

    wraparound</I

    transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future --- which

    get at it.)
   </P
><P

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    against XID wraparound was to re-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    billion transactions. This of course was not very satisfactory for
    high-traffic sites, so a better solution has been devised. The new
    approach allows a server to remain up indefinitely, without
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    maintenance requirement: <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

   </P
><P
>    In practice this isn't an onerous requirement, but since the
    consequences of failing to meet it can be complete data loss (not
    just wasted disk space or slow performance), some special provisions
    have been made to help database administrators keep track of the
    time since the last <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>. The remainder of this
    section gives the details.
   </P
><P
>    The new approach to XID comparison distinguishes two special XIDs,
    numbers 1 and 2 (<VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BootstrapXID</VAR
> and
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</VAR
>). These two XIDs are always considered older
    than every normal XID. Normal XIDs (those greater than 2) are
    compared using modulo-2<SUP
>31</SUP
> arithmetic. This means
    that for every normal XID, there are two billion XIDs that are
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"older"</SPAN
> and two billion that are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newer"</SPAN
>; another
    way to say it is that the normal XID space is circular with no
    endpoint. Therefore, once a tuple has been created with a particular
    normal XID, the tuple will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> for
    the next two billion transactions, no matter which normal XID we are
    talking about. If the tuple still exists after more than two billion
    transactions, it will suddenly appear to be in the future. To
    prevent data loss, old tuples must be reassigned the XID
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</VAR
> sometime before they reach the
    two-billion-transactions-old mark. Once they are assigned this
    special XID, they will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> to all
    normal transactions regardless of wraparound issues, and so such
    tuples will be good until deleted, no matter how long that is. This
    reassignment of XID is handled by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>'s normal policy is to reassign <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</VAR
>
    to any tuple with a normal XID more than one billion transactions in the
    past.  This policy preserves the original insertion XID until it is not
    likely to be of interest anymore.  (In fact, most tuples will probably
    live and die without ever being <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frozen"</SPAN
>.)  With this policy,
    the maximum safe interval between <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> runs on any table
    is exactly one billion transactions: if you wait longer, it's possible
    that a tuple that was not quite old enough to be reassigned last time
    is now more than two billion transactions old and has wrapped around
    into the future --- i.e., is lost to you.  (Of course, it'll reappear
    after another two billion transactions, but that's no help.)
   </P
><P
>    Since periodic <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> runs are needed anyway for the reasons
    described earlier, it's unlikely that any table would not be vacuumed
    for as long as a billion transactions.  But to help administrators ensure
    this constraint is met, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> stores transaction ID
    statistics in the system table <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_database</VAR
>.  In particular,
    the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>datfrozenxid</VAR
> column of a database's
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_database</VAR
> row is updated at the completion of any
    database-wide vacuum operation (i.e., <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> that does not
    name a specific table).  The value stored in this field is the freeze
    cutoff XID that was used by that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> command.  All normal
    XIDs older than this cutoff XID are guaranteed to have been replaced by
    <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</VAR
> within that database.  A convenient way to
    examine this information is to execute the query

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid) FROM pg_database;</PRE
><P>

    The <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>age</VAR
> column measures the number of transactions from the
    cutoff XID to the current transaction's XID.
   </P
><P
>    With the standard freezing policy, the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>age</VAR
> column will start
    at one billion for a freshly-vacuumed database.  When the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>age</VAR
>
    approaches two billion, the database must be vacuumed again to avoid
    risk of wraparound failures.  Recommended practice is to vacuum each
    database at least once every half-a-billion (500 million) transactions,
    so as to provide plenty of safety margin.  To help meet this rule,
    each database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    if there are any <VAR

    <VAR

   </P

    aggressive freezing policy: tuples are frozen if they are old enough

    database, it is guaranteed that <SPAN

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

    database will be frozen. Hence, as long as the database is not
    modified in any way, it will not need subsequent vacuuming to avoid
    transaction ID wraparound problems. This technique is used by
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT

    It should also be used to prepare any user-created databases that

    <VAR

    <TT

    with <VAR
