   a regular basis to keep a <SPAN

   in nature and can easily be automated using standard Unix tools such
   as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

   administrator's responsibility to set up appropriate scripts, and to
   check that they execute successfully.
  </P
><P
>   One obvious maintenance task is creation of backup copies of the data on a
   regular schedule.  Without a recent backup, you have no chance of recovery
   after a catastrophe (disk failure, fire, mistakenly dropping a critical
   table, etc.).  The backup and recovery mechanisms available in
   <SPAN

   <A

   The frequency and scope of the <TT

   understand these issues and develop an appropriate maintenance
   strategy.  This section concentrates on explaining the high-level
   issues; for details about command syntax and so on, see the <A

   Routine vacuuming is therefore not nearly as intrusive as it was in prior

    This approach is necessary to gain the benefits of multiversion
    concurrency control (see <A
HREF="mvcc.html"
>Chapter 12</A
>): the row version
    must not be deleted while it is still potentially visible to other
    transactions. But eventually, an outdated or deleted row version is no
    longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must be
    reclaimed for reuse by new rows, to avoid infinite growth of disk
    space requirements. This is done by running <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

   </P
><P

    to be vacuumed more often than tables that are seldom updated. It
    may be useful to set up periodic <SPAN

    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    change often. This is only likely to be helpful if you have both
    large heavily-updated tables and large seldom-updated tables &mdash; the
    extra cost of vacuuming a small table isn't enough to be worth
    worrying about.
   </P
><P
>    There are two variants of the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    command. The first form, known as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lazy vacuum"</SPAN

    just <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>, marks expired data in tables and
    indexes for future reuse; it does <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> attempt
    to reclaim the space used by this expired data
    immediately. Therefore, the table file is not shortened, and any
    unused space in the file is not returned to the operating
    system. This variant of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> can be run
    concurrently with normal database operations.
   </P
><P
>    The second form is the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
>
    command. This uses a more aggressive algorithm for reclaiming the
    space consumed by expired row versions. Any space that is freed by
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> is immediately returned to the
    operating system. Unfortunately, this variant of the
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    each table while <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT

    it. Therefore, frequently using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

> can
    have an extremely negative effect on the performance of concurrent
    database queries.
   </P
><P
>    The standard form of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> is best used with the goal
    of maintaining a fairly level steady-state usage of disk space. If
    you need to return disk space to the operating system you can use
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> &mdash; but what's the point of releasing disk
    space that will only have to be allocated again soon?  Moderately
    frequent standard <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> runs are a better approach
    than infrequent <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> runs for maintaining
    heavily-updated tables.
   </P
><P
>    Recommended practice for most sites is to schedule a database-wide
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> once a day at a low-usage time of day,
    supplemented by more frequent vacuuming of heavily-updated tables
    if necessary. (Some installations with an extremely high
    rate of data modification <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> busy tables as
    often as once every few minutes.)  If you have multiple databases
    in a cluster, don't forget to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    the program <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vacuumdb</TT
> may be helpful.
   </P
><P
>    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT

    you have deleted the majority of rows in a table, so that the
    steady-state size of the table can be shrunk substantially with
    <TT

>    The <SPAN

    statistical information about the contents of tables in order to

    degrade database performance.
   </P
><P
>    As with vacuuming for space recovery, frequent updates of statistics
    are more useful for heavily-updated tables than for seldom-updated
    ones. But even for a heavily-updated table, there may be no need for
    statistics updates if the statistical distribution of the data is
    not changing much. A simple rule of thumb is to think about how much
    the minimum and maximum values of the columns in the table change.
    For example, a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> column that contains the time
    of row update will have a constantly-increasing maximum value as
    rows are added and updated; such a column will probably need more
    frequent statistics updates than, say, a column containing URLs for
    pages accessed on a website. The URL column may receive changes just
    as often, but the statistical distribution of its values probably
    changes relatively slowly.
   </P
><P
>    It is possible to run <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT

    just specific columns of a table, so the flexibility exists to update some
    statistics more frequently than others if your application requires it.
    In practice, however, the usefulness of this feature is doubtful.
    Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 7.2,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> is a fairly fast operation even on large tables,
    because it uses a statistical random sampling of the rows of a table
    rather than reading every single row.  So it's probably much simpler
    to just run it over the whole database every so often.

    wraparound</I
>: the XID counter wraps around to zero, and all of a sudden
    transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future &mdash; which

    get at it.)
   </P
><P
>    Prior to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    against XID wraparound was to re-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    billion transactions. This of course was not very satisfactory for
    high-traffic sites, so a better solution has been devised. The new
    approach allows a server to remain up indefinitely, without
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT

    maintenance requirement: <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

    be vacuumed at least once every billion transactions</I
></SPAN
>.
   </P
><P
>    In practice this isn't an onerous requirement, but since the
    consequences of failing to meet it can be complete data loss (not
    just wasted disk space or slow performance), some special provisions
    have been made to help database administrators avoid disaster.
    For each database in the cluster, <SPAN

    keeps track of the time of the last database-wide <TT

    When any database approaches the billion-transaction danger level,
    the system begins to emit warning messages.  If nothing is done, it
    will eventually shut down normal operations until appropriate
    manual maintenance is done.  The remainder of this
    section gives the details.
   </P
><P
>    The new approach to XID comparison distinguishes two special XIDs,
    numbers 1 and 2 (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BootstrapXID</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
>). These two XIDs are always considered older
    than every normal XID. Normal XIDs (those greater than 2) are
    compared using modulo-2<SUP
>31</SUP

    that for every normal XID, there are two billion XIDs that are
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"older"</SPAN
> and two billion that are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newer"</SPAN
>; another
    way to say it is that the normal XID space is circular with no
    endpoint. Therefore, once a row version has been created with a particular
    normal XID, the row version will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> for
    the next two billion transactions, no matter which normal XID we are
    talking about. If the row version still exists after more than two billion
    transactions, it will suddenly appear to be in the future. To
    prevent data loss, old row versions must be reassigned the XID
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
> sometime before they reach the
    two-billion-transactions-old mark. Once they are assigned this
    special XID, they will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> to all
    normal transactions regardless of wraparound issues, and so such
    row versions will be good until deleted, no matter how long that is. This
    reassignment of XID is handled by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
>
    to any row version with a normal XID more than one billion transactions in the
    past.  This policy preserves the original insertion XID until it is not
    likely to be of interest anymore.  (In fact, most row versions will probably
    live and die without ever being <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frozen"</SPAN
>.)  With this policy,
    the maximum safe interval between <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    is exactly one billion transactions: if you wait longer, it's possible
    that a row version that was not quite old enough to be reassigned last time
    is now more than two billion transactions old and has wrapped around
    into the future &mdash; i.e., is lost to you.  (Of course, it'll reappear
    after another two billion transactions, but that's no help.)
   </P
><P
>    Since periodic <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    described earlier, it's unlikely that any table would not be vacuumed

    this constraint is met, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    statistics in the system table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_database</TT

    the <TT

    <TT

    database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> operation (i.e.,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> that does not
    name a specific table).  The value stored in this field is the freeze
    cutoff XID that was used by that <TT

>VACUUM</TT

    XIDs older than this cutoff XID are guaranteed to have been replaced by
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT

    examine this information is to execute the query

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    The <TT

   </P
><P
>    With the standard freezing policy, the <TT

    at one billion for a freshly-vacuumed database.  When the <TT

    The 1-million-transaction safety margin exists to let the

    required <TT

></H2
><A
NAME="AEN22645"
></A
><P
>    Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL </SPAN
> 8.1, there is a
    separate optional server process called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>autovacuum
    daemon</I
>, whose purpose is to automate the issuance of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE </TT
> commands.
    When enabled, the autovacuum daemon runs periodically and checks for
    tables that have had a large number of inserted, updated or deleted
    tuples.  These checks use the row-level statistics collection facility;
    therefore, the autovacuum daemon cannot be used unless <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-STATS-START-COLLECTOR"
>stats_start_collector</A
> and <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-STATS-ROW-LEVEL"
>stats_row_level</A
> are set <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
>.  Also, it's
    important to allow a slot for the autovacuum process when choosing the
    value of <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SUPERUSER-RESERVED-CONNECTIONS"
>superuser_reserved_connections</A
>.
   </P
><P
>    The autovacuum daemon, when enabled, runs every <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-NAPTIME"
>autovacuum_naptime</A
> seconds and determines which database
    to process.  Any database which is close to transaction ID wraparound
    is immediately processed.  In this case, autovacuum issues a
    database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> call, or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM
    FREEZE</TT
> if it's a template database, and then terminates.  If
    no database fulfills this criterion, the one that was least recently
    processed by autovacuum itself is chosen.  In this mode, each table in
    the database is checked for new and obsolete tuples, according to the
    applicable autovacuum parameters.  If a <A
HREF="catalog-pg-autovacuum.html"
>    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
></A
> tuple is found for this
    table, these settings are applied; otherwise the global values in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> are used.  See <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html"
>Section 17.9</A
>
    for more details on the global settings.
   </P
><P
>    For each table, two conditions are used to determine which operation to
    apply.  If the number of obsolete tuples since the last
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> exceeds the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"vacuum threshold"</SPAN
>, the
    table is vacuumed and analyzed.  The vacuum threshold is defined as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>vacuum threshold = vacuum base threshold + vacuum scale factor * number of tuples</PRE
><P>
    where the vacuum base threshold is
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>vac_base_thresh</TT
>,
    the vacuum scale factor is
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>vac_scale_factor</TT
>
    and the number of tuples is
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_class</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>reltuples</TT
>.
    The number of obsolete tuples is taken from the statistics
    collector, which is a semi-accurate count updated by each
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> operation.  (It
    is only semi-accurate because some information may be lost under heavy
    load.)  For analyze, a similar condition is used: the threshold, calculated
    by an equivalent equation to that above, is compared to the number of
    new tuples, that is, those created by the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> commands.
   </P
><P
>    Note that if any of the values in <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>
    is set to a negative number, or if a tuple is not present at all in
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
> for any particular table, the
    equivalent value from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> is used.
   </P
><P
>    Besides the base threshold values and scale factors, there are three
    parameters that can be set for each table in <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>: 
    the vacuum cost delay
    (<TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>vac_cost_delay</TT
>)
    and the vacuum cost limit
    (<TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>vac_cost_limit</TT
>).
    They are used to set table-specific values for the
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-VACUUM-COST"
><I
>Cost-Based Vacuum Delay</I
></A
>
    feature.  The above note about negative values also applies here, but
    also note that if the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> variables
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay</TT
> are also set to negative 
    values, the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>vacuum_cost_limit</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>vacuum_cost_delay</TT
> values will be used instead.
    The other parameter, <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>enabled</TT
>,
    can be used to instruct the autovacuum daemon to skip any particular table
    by setting it to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT
>.
