>    Locale support is automatically initialized when a database
    cluster is created using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
>.
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> will initialize the database cluster
    with the locale setting of its execution environment by default,
    so if your system is already set to use the locale that you want
    in your database cluster then there is nothing else you need to
    do.  If you want to use a different locale (or you are not sure
    which locale your system is set to), you can instruct
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> exactly which locale to use by
    specifying the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--locale</TT
> option. For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>initdb --locale=sv_SE</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This example sets the locale to Swedish (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sv</TT
>) as spoken
    in Sweden (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SE</TT
>).  Other possibilities might be
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>en_US</TT
> (U.S. English) and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fr_CA</TT
> (French
    Canadian).  If more than one character set can be useful for a
    locale then the specifications look like this:
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cs_CZ.ISO8859-2</TT
>. What locales are available under what
    names on your system depends on what was provided by the operating
    system vendor and what was installed.
   </P
><P
>    Occasionally it is useful to mix rules from several locales, e.g.,
    use English collation rules but Spanish messages.  To support that, a
    set of locale subcategories exist that control only a certain
    aspect of the localization rules.

    The category names translate into names of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> options to override the locale choice
    for a specific category.  For instance, to set the locale to
    French Canadian, but use U.S. rules for formatting currency, use
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>initdb --locale=fr_CA --lc-monetary=en_US</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    If you want the system to behave as if it had no locale support,
    use the special locale <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSIX</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    The nature of some locale categories is that their value has to be
    fixed for the lifetime of a database cluster.  That is, once
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> has run, you cannot change them anymore.
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LC_COLLATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LC_CTYPE</TT
> are
    those categories.  They affect the sort order of indexes, so they
    must be kept fixed, or indexes on text columns will become corrupt.
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> enforces this by recording
    the values of <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_COLLATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_CTYPE</TT
> that are
    seen by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
>.  The server automatically adopts
    those two values when it is started.
   </P
><P
>    The other locale categories can be changed as desired whenever the
    server is running by setting the run-time configuration variables
    that have the same name as the locale categories (see <A
HREF="runtime-config.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-FORMAT"
>Section 16.4.8.2</A
> for details).  The defaults that are
    chosen by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> are actually only written into
    the configuration file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> to
    serve as defaults when the server is started.  If you delete the
    assignments from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> then the
    server will inherit the settings from the execution environment.
   </P
><P
>    Note that the locale behavior of the server is determined by the
    environment variables seen by the server, not by the environment
    of any client.  Therefore, be careful to configure the correct locale settings
    before starting the server.  A consequence of this is that if
    client and server are set up to different locales, messages may
    appear in different languages depending on where they originated.

>Note: </B
>     When we speak of inheriting the locale from the execution
     environment, this means the following on most operating systems:
     For a given locale category, say the collation, the following
     environment variables are consulted in this order until one is
     found to be set: <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_ALL</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_COLLATE</TT
>
     (the variable corresponding to the respective category),
     <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANG</TT
>.  If none of these environment variables are
     set then the locale defaults to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>     Some message localization libraries also look at the environment
     variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANGUAGE</TT
> which overrides all other locale
     settings for the purpose of setting the language of messages.  If
     in doubt, please refer to the documentation of your operating
     system, in particular the documentation about
     <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gettext</SPAN
>, for more information.
