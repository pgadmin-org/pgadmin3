<a name="id2629078"></a><p>   The internal data storage format changes with new releases of
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>. Therefore, if you are upgrading an
   existing installation that does not have a version number
   &#8220;<span class="quote">8.2.x</span>&#8221;, you must back up and restore your
   data as shown here. These instructions assume that your existing
   installation is under the <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql</code> directory,
   and that the data area is in <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql/data</code>.
   Substitute your paths appropriately.
  </p>
<div class="procedure"><ol type="1">
<li><p>     Make sure that your database is not updated during or after the
     backup. This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the
     changed data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit
     the permissions in the file
     <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</code> (or equivalent) to
     disallow access from everyone except you.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p>     <a name="id2629143"></a>

     To back up your database installation, type:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>pg_dumpall &gt; <em class="replaceable"><code>outputfile</code></em></code></strong></pre>
<p>
     If you need to preserve OIDs (such as when using them as
     foreign keys), then use the <code class="option">-o</code> option when running
     <span class="application">pg_dumpall</span>.
    </p>
<p>     To make the backup, you can use the <span class="application">pg_dumpall</span>
     command from the version you are currently running.  For best
     results, however, try to use the <span class="application">pg_dumpall</span>
     command from <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.2.2,
     since this version contains bug fixes and improvements over older
     versions.  While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you
     haven't installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow
     it if you plan to install the new version in parallel with the
     old version.  In that case you can complete the installation
     normally and transfer the data later.  This will also decrease
     the downtime.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     If you are installing the new version at the same location as the
     old one then shut down the old server, at the latest before you
     install the new files:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>pg_ctl stop</code></strong></pre>
<p>
     On systems that have <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> started at boot time,
     there is probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
     example, on a <span class="systemitem">Red Hat Linux</span> system one
     might find that
</p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql stop</code></strong></pre>
<p>
     works.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     If you are installing in the same place as the old version then
     it is also a good idea to move the old installation out of the
     way, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.
     Use a command like this:
</p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old</code></strong></pre>
<p>
    </p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>   After you have installed <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.2.2, create a new database
   directory and start the new server. Remember that you must execute
   these commands while logged in to the special database user account
   (which you already have if you are upgrading).
</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><strong class="userinput"><code>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</code></strong>
<strong class="userinput"><code>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</code></strong></pre>
<p>
   Finally, restore your data with
</p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d postgres -f <em class="replaceable"><code>outputfile</code></em></code></strong></pre>
<p>
   using the <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> <span class="application">psql</span>.
