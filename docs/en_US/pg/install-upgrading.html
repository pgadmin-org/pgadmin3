     results, however, try to use the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dumpall</SPAN

     command from <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.0.0beta3,
     since this version contains bug fixes and improvements over older
     versions.  While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you
     haven't installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow
     it if you plan to install the new version in parallel with the
     old version.  In that case you can complete the installation
     normally and transfer the data later.  This will also decrease
     the downtime.

     Versions prior to 7.0 do not have this
     <TT

     you must find out the process ID of the server yourself, for
     example by typing <KBD

>ps ax | grep postmaster</KBD

     supply it to the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kill</TT

>     On systems that have <SPAN

     probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For
     example, on a <SPAN

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

><P

     it is also a good idea to move the old installation out of the
     way, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.
     Use a command like this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

><P
>   After you have installed <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.0.0beta3, create a new database
   directory and start the new server. Remember that you must execute
   these commands while logged in to the special database user account
   (which you already have if you are upgrading).
