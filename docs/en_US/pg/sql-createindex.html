<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre class="synopsis">CREATE [ UNIQUE ] INDEX [ CONCURRENTLY ] <em class="replaceable"><code>name</code></em> ON <em class="replaceable"><code>table</code></em> [ USING <em class="replaceable"><code>method</code></em> ]
    ( { <em class="replaceable"><code>column</code></em> | ( <em class="replaceable"><code>expression</code></em> ) } [ <em class="replaceable"><code>opclass</code></em> ] [, ...] )
    [ WITH ( <em class="replaceable"><code>storage_parameter</code></em> = <em class="replaceable"><code>value</code></em> [, ... ] ) ]

</div>
<div class="refsect1" lang="en">
<a name="id2755702"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>   <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> constructs an index <em class="replaceable"><code>index_name</code></em> on the specified table.
   Indexes are primarily used to enhance database performance (though
   inappropriate use can result in slower performance).
  </p>
<p>   The key field(s) for the index are specified as column names,
   or alternatively as expressions written in parentheses.
   Multiple fields can be specified if the index method supports
   multicolumn indexes.
  </p>
<p>   An index field can be an expression computed from the values of
   one or more columns of the table row.  This feature can be used
   to obtain fast access to data based on some transformation of
   the basic data. For example, an index computed on
   <code class="literal">upper(col)</code> would allow the clause
   <code class="literal">WHERE upper(col) = 'JIM'</code> to use an index.
  </p>
<p>   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> provides the index methods
   B-tree, hash, GiST, and GIN.  Users can also define their own index
   methods, but that is fairly complicated.
  </p>
<p>    When the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause is present, a
    <em class="firstterm">partial index</em> is created.
    A partial index is an index that contains entries for only a portion of
    a table, usually a portion that is more useful for indexing than the
    rest of the table. For example, if you have a table that contains both
    billed and unbilled orders where the unbilled orders take up a small
    fraction of the total table and yet that is an often used section, you
    can improve performance by creating an index on just that portion.
    Another possible application is to use <code class="literal">WHERE</code> with
    <code class="literal">UNIQUE</code> to enforce uniqueness over a subset of a
    table.  See <a href="indexes-partial.html" title="11.7. Partial Indexes">Section 11.7, &#8220;Partial Indexes&#8221;</a> for more discussion.
  </p>
<p>    The expression used in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause may refer
    only to columns of the underlying table, but it can use all columns,
    not just the ones being indexed.  Presently, subqueries and
    aggregate expressions are also forbidden in <code class="literal">WHERE</code>.
    The same restrictions apply to index fields that are expressions.
  </p>
<p>   All functions and operators used in an index definition must be
   &#8220;<span class="quote">immutable</span>&#8221;, that is, their results must depend only on
   their arguments and never on any outside influence (such as
   the contents of another table or the current time).  This restriction
   ensures that the behavior of the index is well-defined.  To use a
   user-defined function in an index expression or <code class="literal">WHERE</code>
   clause, remember to mark the function immutable when you create it.

<a name="sql-createindex-storage-parameters"></a><h3>Index Storage Parameters</h3>
<p>    The <code class="literal">WITH</code> clause can specify <em class="firstterm">storage parameters</em>
    for indexes.  Each index method can have its own set of allowed storage
    parameters.  The built-in index methods all accept a single parameter:
   </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">FILLFACTOR</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>      The fillfactor for an index is a percentage that determines how full
      the index method will try to pack index pages.  For B-trees, leaf pages
      are filled to this percentage during initial index build, and also
      when extending the index at the right (largest key values).  If pages
      subsequently become completely full, they will be split, leading to
      gradual degradation in the index's efficiency.  B-trees use a default
      fillfactor of 90, but any value from 10 to 100 can be selected.
      If the table is static then fillfactor 100 is best to minimize the
      index's physical size, but for heavily updated tables a smaller
      fillfactor is better to minimize the need for page splits.  The
      other index methods use fillfactor in different but roughly analogous
      ways; the default fillfactor varies between methods.

<div class="refsect2" lang="en">
<a name="sql-createindex-concurrently"></a><h3>Building Indexes Concurrently</h3>
<a name="id2756095"></a><p>    Creating an index can interfere with regular operation of a database.
    Normally <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> locks the table to be indexed against
    writes and performs the entire index build with a single scan of the
    table. Other transactions can still read the table, but if they try to
    insert, update, or delete rows in the table they will block until the
    index build is finished. This could have a severe effect if the system is
    a live production database. Large tables can take many hours to be
    indexed, and even for smaller tables, an index build can lock out writers
    for periods that are unacceptably long for a production system.
   </p>
<p>    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports building indexes without locking
    out writes.  This method is invoked by specifying the
    <code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code> option of <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code>.
    When this option is used,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> must perform two scans of the table, and in
    addition it must wait for all existing transactions to terminate.  Thus
    this method requires more total work than a standard index build and takes
    significantly longer to complete.  However, since it allows normal
    operations to continue while the index is built, this method is useful for
    adding new indexes in a production environment.  Of course, the extra CPU
    and I/O load imposed by the index creation may slow other operations.
   </p>
<p>    If a problem arises during the second scan of the table, such as a
    uniqueness violation in a unique index, the <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code>
    command will fail but leave behind an &#8220;<span class="quote">invalid</span>&#8221; index. This index
    will be ignored for querying purposes because it may be incomplete;
    however it will still consume update overhead.  The recommended recovery
    method in such cases is to drop the index and try again to perform
    <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>.  (Another possibility is to rebuild
    the index with <code class="command">REINDEX</code>.  However, since <code class="command">REINDEX</code>
    does not support concurrent builds, this option is unlikely to seem
    attractive.)
   </p>
<p>    Another caveat when building a unique index concurrently is that the
    uniqueness constraint is already being enforced against other transactions
    when the second table scan begins.  This means that constraint violations
    could be reported in other queries prior to the index becoming available
    for use, or even in cases where the index build eventually fails.  Also,
    if a failure does occur in the second scan, the &#8220;<span class="quote">invalid</span>&#8221; index
    continues to enforce its uniqueness constraint afterwards.
   </p>
<p>    Concurrent builds of expression indexes and partial indexes are supported.
    Errors occurring in the evaluation of these expressions could cause
    behavior similar to that described above for unique constraint violations.
   </p>
<p>    Regular index builds permit other regular index builds on the
    same table to occur in parallel, but only one concurrent index build
    can occur on a table at a time.  In both cases, no other types of schema
    modification on the table are allowed meanwhile.  Another difference
    is that a regular <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> command can be performed within
    a transaction block, but <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> cannot.

<a name="id2756243"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>   See <a href="indexes.html" title="Chapter 11. Indexes">Chapter 11, <i>Indexes</i></a> for information about when indexes can
   be used, when they are not used, and in which particular situations
   they can be useful.
  </p>
<p>   Currently, only the B-tree and GiST index methods support
   multicolumn indexes. Up to 32 fields may be specified by default.
   (This limit can be altered when building
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.)  Only B-tree currently
   supports unique indexes.
  </p>
<p>   An <em class="firstterm">operator class</em> can be specified for each
   column of an index. The operator class identifies the operators to be
   used by the index for that column. For example, a B-tree index on
   four-byte integers would use the <code class="literal">int4_ops</code> class;
   this operator class includes comparison functions for four-byte
   integers. In practice the default operator class for the column's data
   type is usually sufficient. The main point of having operator classes
   is that for some data types, there could be more than one meaningful
   ordering. For example, we might want to sort a complex-number data
   type either by absolute value or by real part. We could do this by
   defining two operator classes for the data type and then selecting
   the proper class when making an index.  More information about
   operator classes is in <a href="indexes-opclass.html" title="11.8. Operator Classes">Section 11.8, &#8220;Operator Classes&#8221;</a> and in <a href="xindex.html" title="33.14. Interfacing Extensions To Indexes">Section 33.14, &#8220;Interfacing Extensions To Indexes&#8221;</a>.
  </p>
<p>   Use <a href="sql-dropindex.html" title="DROP INDEX">DROP INDEX</a>
   to remove an index.
  </p>
<p>   Indexes are not used for <code class="literal">IS NULL</code> clauses by default.
   The best way to use indexes in such cases is to create a partial index
   using an <code class="literal">IS NULL</code> predicate.
  </p>
<p>   Prior releases of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> also had an
   R-tree index method.  This method has been removed because
   it had no significant advantages over the GiST method.
   If <code class="literal">USING rtree</code> is specified, <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code>
   will interpret it as <code class="literal">USING gist</code>, to simplify conversion
   of old databases to GiST.
