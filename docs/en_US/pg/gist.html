In the box example, we
are supposed to see a performance gain when using the GiST index; it did
work for me but I do not have a reasonably large collection of boxes
to check that. Other examples also worked, except polygons: I got an 
error doing

>I could not get sense of this error message; it appears to be something
we'd rather ask the developers about (see also Note 4 below). What I
would suggest here is that someone of you linux guys (linux==gcc?) fetch the 
original sources quoted above and apply my patch (see attachment) and 
tell us what you feel about it. Looks cool to me, but I would not like 
to hold it up while there are so many competent people around.</P
><P
>A few notes on the sources:</P
><P
>1. I failed to make use of the original (HP-UX) Makefile and rearranged
   the Makefile from the ancient postgres95 tutorial to do the job. I tried
   to keep it generic, but I am a very poor makefile writer -- just did
   some monkey work. Sorry about that, but I guess it is now a little
   more portable that the original makefile.</P
><P
>2. I built the example sources right under pgsql/src (just extracted the
   tar file there). The aforementioned Makefile assumes it is one level
   below pgsql/src (in our case, in pgsql/src/pggist).</P
><P
>3. The changes I made to the *.c files were all about #include's,
   function prototypes and typecasting. Other than that, I just threw 
   away a bunch of unused vars and added a couple parentheses to please
   gcc. I hope I did not screw up too much :)</P
><P
>4. There is a comment in polyproc.sql:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>-- -- there's a memory leak in rtree poly_ops!!
-- -- CREATE INDEX pix2 ON polytmp USING RTREE (p poly_ops);</PRE
><P>

   Roger that!! I thought it could be related to a number of
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> versions
   back and tried the query. My system went nuts and I had to shoot down
   the postmaster in about ten minutes.</P
><P
>I will continue to look into GiST for a while, but I would also
appreciate
more examples of R-tree usage.</P
