<p>   <code class="command">REINDEX</code> rebuilds an index using the data
   stored in the index's table, replacing the old copy of the index. There are
   two main reasons to use <code class="command">REINDEX</code>:

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      An index has become corrupted, and no longer contains valid
      data. Although in theory this should never happen, in
      practice indexes may become corrupted due to software bugs or
      hardware failures.  <code class="command">REINDEX</code> provides a
      recovery method.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      The index in question contains a lot of dead index pages that
      are not being reclaimed. This can occur with B-tree indexes in
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> under certain access
      patterns. <code class="command">REINDEX</code> provides a way to reduce
      the space consumption of the index by writing a new version of
      the index without the dead pages. See <a href="routine-reindex.html" title="22.2. Routine Reindexing">Section 22.2, &#8220;Routine Reindexing&#8221;</a> for more information.

<a name="id2748617"></a><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>   If you suspect corruption of an index on a user table, you can
   simply rebuild that index, or all indexes on the table, using
   <code class="command">REINDEX INDEX</code> or <code class="command">REINDEX TABLE</code>.  
  </p>
<p>   Things are more difficult if you need to recover from corruption of
   an index on a system table.  In this case it's important for the
   system to not have used any of the suspect indexes itself.
   (Indeed, in this sort of scenario you may find that server
   processes are crashing immediately at start-up, due to reliance on
   the corrupted indexes.)  To recover safely, the server must be started
   with the <code class="option">-P</code> option, which prevents it from using
   indexes for system catalog lookups.
  </p>
<p>   One way to do this is to shut down the postmaster and start a stand-alone
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server
   with the <code class="option">-P</code> option included on its command line.
   Then, <code class="command">REINDEX DATABASE</code>, <code class="command">REINDEX SYSTEM</code>,
   <code class="command">REINDEX TABLE</code>, or <code class="command">REINDEX INDEX</code> can be
   issued, depending on how much you want to reconstruct.  If in
   doubt, use <code class="command">REINDEX SYSTEM</code> to select
   reconstruction of all system indexes in the database.  Then quit
   the standalone server session and restart the regular server.
   See the <a href="app-postgres.html" title="postgres"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-postgres-title"></a><span class="application">postgres</span></span></a> reference page for more
   information about how to interact with the stand-alone server
   interface.
  </p>
<p>   Alternatively, a regular server session can be started with
   <code class="option">-P</code> included in its command line options.
   The method for doing this varies across clients, but in all
   <span class="application">libpq</span>-based clients, it is possible to set
   the <code class="envar">PGOPTIONS</code> environment variable to <code class="literal">-P</code>
   before starting the client.  Note that while this method does not
   require locking out other clients, it may still be wise to prevent
   other users from connecting to the damaged database until repairs
   have been completed.
  </p>
<p>   If corruption is suspected in the indexes of any of the shared
   system catalogs (which are <code class="structname">pg_authid</code>,
   <code class="structname">pg_auth_members</code>,
   <code class="structname">pg_database</code>,
   <code class="structname">pg_pltemplate</code>,
   <code class="structname">pg_shdepend</code>, and
   <code class="structname">pg_tablespace</code>), then a standalone server
   must be used to repair it.  <code class="command">REINDEX</code> will not process
   shared catalogs in multiuser mode.
  </p>
<p>   For all indexes except the shared system catalogs, <code class="command">REINDEX</code>
   is crash-safe and transaction-safe.  <code class="command">REINDEX</code> is not
   crash-safe for shared indexes, which is why this case is disallowed
   during normal operation.  If a failure occurs while reindexing one
   of these catalogs in standalone mode, it will not be possible to
   restart the regular server until the problem is rectified.  (The
   typical symptom of a partially rebuilt shared index is &#8220;<span class="quote">index is not
   a btree</span>&#8221; errors.)
  </p>
<p>   <code class="command">REINDEX</code> is similar to a drop and recreate of the index
   in that the index contents are rebuilt from scratch.  However, the locking
   considerations are rather different.  <code class="command">REINDEX</code> locks out writes
   but not reads of the index's parent table.  It also takes an exclusive lock
   on the specific index being processed, which will block reads that attempt
   to use that index.  In contrast, <code class="command">DROP INDEX</code> momentarily takes
   exclusive lock on the parent table, blocking both writes and reads.  The
   subsequent <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> locks out writes but not reads; since
   the index is not there, no read will attempt to use it, meaning that there
   will be no blocking but reads may be forced into expensive sequential
   scans.  Another important point is that the drop/create approach
   invalidates any cached query plans that use the index, while
   <code class="command">REINDEX</code> does not.
  </p>
<p>   Reindexing a single index or table requires being the owner of that
   index or table.  Reindexing a database requires being the owner of
   the database (note that the owner can therefore rebuild indexes of
   tables owned by other users).  Of course, superusers can always
   reindex anything.
  </p>
<p>   Prior to <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.1, <code class="command">REINDEX
   DATABASE</code> processed only system indexes, not all indexes as one would
   expect from the name.  This has been changed to reduce the surprise
   factor.  The old behavior is available as <code class="command">REINDEX SYSTEM</code>.
  </p>
<p>   Prior to <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 7.4, <code class="command">REINDEX
   TABLE</code> did not automatically process TOAST tables, and so those had
   to be reindexed by separate commands.  This is still possible, but
   redundant.

<a name="id2748888"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>   Recreate the indexes on the table <code class="literal">my_table</code>:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">REINDEX TABLE my_table;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Rebuild a single index:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">REINDEX INDEX my_index;</pre>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   Rebuild all indexes in a particular database, without trusting the
   system indexes to be valid already:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>export PGOPTIONS="-P"</code></strong>
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>psql broken_db</code></strong>

<p>   There is no <code class="command">REINDEX</code> command in the SQL standard.
