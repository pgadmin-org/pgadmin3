    is that the information about a view in the

    the same as it is for a table. So for the parser, there is

    be a view that behaves like a real table with some magic
    functionality.  This is not such a simple example to start from and
    this makes things harder to get into. But it's better to have one
    example that covers all the points discussed step by step rather
    than having many different ones that might mix up in mind.</P

     There is one difference however: the subquery's range table has two
     extra entries <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace *OLD*</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace *NEW*</TT
>.  These entries don't
     participate directly in the query, since they aren't referenced by
     the subquery's join tree or target list.  The rewriter uses them
     to store the access privilege check information that was originally present
     in the range-table entry that referenced the view.  In this way, the
     executor will still check that the user has proper privileges to access
     the view, even though there's no direct use of the view in the rewritten
     query.</P
><P
>    That was the first rule applied.  The rule system will continue checking
    the remaining range-table entries in the top query (in this example there
    are no more), and it will recursively check the range-table entries in
    the added subquery to see if any of them reference views.  (But it
    won't expand <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*OLD*</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*NEW*</TT

    In this example, there are no rewrite rules for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_data</TT

>unit</TT

    so rewriting is complete and the above is the final result given to
    the planner.</P

    and thus the executor run over the join will produce exactly the

    will do. But there is a little problem in
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>: The executor does not care what the
    results from the join it is doing are meant for. It just produces
    a result set of rows. The difference that one is a
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> command and the other is an
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> is handled in the caller of the
    executor. The caller still knows (looking at the query tree) that
    this is an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and it knows that this
    result should go into table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1</TT
>. But which of the rows that are
    there has to be replaced by the new row?</P
><P
>    To resolve this problem, another entry is added to the target list
    in <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> (and also in
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>) statements: the current tuple ID
    (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
>).<A
NAME="AEN30283"

>  This is a system column containing the
    file block number and position in the block for the row. Knowing
    the table, the <ACRONYM

    original row of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1</TT

CLASS="ACRONYM"

    to the target list, the query actually looks like

    Now another detail of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> enters
    the stage. Old table rows aren't overwritten, and this
    is why <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ROLLBACK</TT
> is fast. In an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>,
    the new result row is inserted into the table (after stripping the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
>) and in the row header of the old row, which the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
> pointed to, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cmax</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xmax</TT
> entries are set to the current command counter
    and current transaction ID. Thus the old row is hidden, and after
    the transaction committed the vacuum cleaner can really move it
    out.</P

>    The above demonstrates how the rule system incorporates view
    definitions into the original query tree. In the second example, a
    simple <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> from one view created a final
    query tree that is a join of 4 tables (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unit</TT
> was used twice with
    different names).</P
><P
>    The benefit of implementing views with the rule system is,
    that the planner has all
    the information about which tables have to be scanned plus the
    relationships between these tables plus the restrictive
    qualifications from the views plus the qualifications from
    the original query
    in one single query tree. And this is still the situation
    when the original query is already a join over views.
    The planner has to decide which is
    the best path to execute the query, and the more information
    the planner has, the better this decision can be. And
    the rule system as implemented in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    ensures, that this is all information available about the query
    up to that point.</P
