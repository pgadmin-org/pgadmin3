    When a transaction runs on this isolation level,
    a <TT

    query began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed
    during query execution by concurrent transactions.  (However, the

    executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet
    committed.)  In effect, a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> query
    sees a snapshot of the database as of the instant that that query
    begins to run.  Notice that two successive <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT

    see different data, even though they are within a single transaction, if
    other transactions 
    commit changes during execution of the first <TT

    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the command start time.  However, such a target
    row may have already been updated (or deleted or marked for update) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with
    updating the originally found row.  If the first updater commits, the
    second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it,
    otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of
    the row.  The search condition of the command (the <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</VAR
> clause) is
    re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the
    search condition.  If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation,
    starting from the updated version of the row.
   </P
><P
>    Because of the above rule, it is possible for an updating command to see an
    inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating
    commands that affected the same rows it is trying to update, but it
    does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database.
    This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that
    involve complex search conditions.  However, it is just right for simpler
    cases.  For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions
    like

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account
    12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start from the updated
    version of the account's row.  Because each command is affecting only a
    predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does
    not create any troublesome inconsistency.
   </P
><P
>    Since in Read Committed mode each new command starts with a new snapshot
    that includes all transactions committed up to that instant, subsequent
    commands in the same transaction will see the effects of the committed
    concurrent transaction in any case.  The point at issue here is whether
    or not within a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>single</I
></SPAN
> command we see an absolutely consistent
    view of the database.
   </P
><P
>    The partial transaction isolation provided by Read Committed mode is
    adequate for many applications, and this mode is fast and simple to use.
    However, for applications that do complex queries and updates, it may
    be necessary to guarantee a more rigorously consistent view of the
    database than the Read Committed mode provides.

    as if transactions had been executed one after another, serially,
    rather than concurrently.  However, applications using this level must
    be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization failures.
   </P
><P
>    When a transaction is on the serializable level,

    that were committed as of the transaction start time.  However, such a
    target
    row may have already been updated (or deleted or marked for update) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    serializable transaction will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the serializable transaction can proceed
    with updating the originally found row.  But if the first updater commits
    (and actually updated or deleted the row, not just selected it for update)
    then the serializable transaction will be rolled back with the message

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ERROR:  Can't serialize access due to concurrent update</PRE
><P>

    because a serializable transaction cannot modify rows changed by
    other transactions after the serializable transaction began.
   </P
><P
>    When the application receives this error message, it should abort
    the current transaction and then retry the whole transaction from
    the beginning.  The second time through, the transaction sees the
    previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database,
    so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row
    as the starting point for the new transaction's update.
   </P
><P
>    Note that only updating transactions may need to be retried; read-only
    transactions will never have serialization conflicts.
   </P
><P
>    The Serializable mode provides a rigorous guarantee that each
    transaction sees a wholly consistent view of the database.  However,
    the application has to be prepared to retry transactions when concurrent
    updates make it impossible to sustain the illusion of serial execution.
    Since the cost of redoing complex transactions may be significant,
    this mode is recommended only when updating transactions contain logic
    sufficiently complex that they may give wrong answers in Read
    Committed mode.  Most commonly, Serializable mode is necessary when
    a transaction executes several successive commands that must see
    identical views of the database.
