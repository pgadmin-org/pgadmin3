>    In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>, you can use all four
    possible transaction isolation levels.  Internally, there are only
    two distinct isolation levels, which correspond to the levels Read
    Committed and Serializable.  When you select the level Read
    Uncommitted you really get Read Committed, and when you select
    Repeatable Read you really get Serializable, so the actual
    isolation level may be stricter than what you select.  This is
    permitted by the SQL standard: the four isolation levels only
    define which phenomena must not happen, they do not define which
    phenomena must happen.  The reason that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    only provides two isolation levels is that this is the only
    sensible way to map the isolation levels to the multiversion
    concurrency control architecture.  The behavior of the available
    isolation levels is detailed in the following subsections.
   </P

    is the default isolation level in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>. 
    When a transaction runs on this isolation level,
    a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> query sees only data committed before the
    query began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed
    during query execution by concurrent transactions.  (However, the
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> does see the effects of previous updates
    executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet
    committed.)  In effect, a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> query
    sees a snapshot of the database as of the instant that that query
    begins to run.  Notice that two successive <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> commands can
    see different data, even though they are within a single transaction, if
    other transactions 
    commit changes during execution of the first <TT

    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the command start time.  However, such a target
    row may have already been updated (or deleted or marked for update) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with
    updating the originally found row.  If the first updater commits, the
    second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it,
    otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of
    the row.  The search condition of the command (the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause) is
    re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the
    search condition.  If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation,
    starting from the updated version of the row.
   </P
><P
>    Because of the above rule, it is possible for an updating command to see an
    inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating
    commands that affected the same rows it is trying to update, but it
    does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database.
    This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that
    involve complex search conditions.  However, it is just right for simpler
    cases.  For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions
    like

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account
    12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start from the updated
    version of the account's row.  Because each command is affecting only a
    predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does
    not create any troublesome inconsistency.
   </P
><P
>    Since in Read Committed mode each new command starts with a new snapshot
    that includes all transactions committed up to that instant, subsequent
    commands in the same transaction will see the effects of the committed
    concurrent transaction in any case.  The point at issue here is whether
    or not within a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>single</I
></SPAN
> command we see an absolutely consistent
    view of the database.
   </P
><P
>    The partial transaction isolation provided by Read Committed mode is
    adequate for many applications, and this mode is fast and simple to use.
    However, for applications that do complex queries and updates, it may
    be necessary to guarantee a more rigorously consistent view of the
    database than the Read Committed mode provides.

    (and actually updated or deleted the row, not just selected it for update)
    then the serializable transaction will be rolled back with the message

    other transactions after the serializable transaction began.
   </P
><P
>    When the application receives this error message, it should abort
    the current transaction and then retry the whole transaction from
    the beginning.  The second time through, the transaction sees the
    previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database,
    so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row
    as the starting point for the new transaction's update.
   </P
><P
>    Note that only updating transactions may need to be retried; read-only
    transactions will never have serialization conflicts.
   </P
><P
>    The Serializable mode provides a rigorous guarantee that each
    transaction sees a wholly consistent view of the database.  However,
    the application has to be prepared to retry transactions when concurrent
    updates make it impossible to sustain the illusion of serial execution.
    Since the cost of redoing complex transactions may be significant,
    this mode is recommended only when updating transactions contain logic
    sufficiently complex that they may give wrong answers in Read
    Committed mode.  Most commonly, Serializable mode is necessary when
    a transaction executes several successive commands that must see
    identical views of the database.

    Such a locking system is complex to
    implement and extremely expensive in execution, since every session must
    be aware of the details of every query executed by every concurrent
    transaction.  And this large expense is mostly wasted, since in
    practice most applications do not do the sorts of things that could
    result in problems.  (Certainly the example above is rather contrived
    and unlikely to represent real software.)  Accordingly,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    locking, and so far as we are aware no other production DBMS does either.
   </P

    explicit locking.  Further discussion appears in the following
