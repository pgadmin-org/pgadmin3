</div>
<p>    Major changes in this release:

    </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">       <tt class="literal">IN</tt> / <tt class="literal">NOT IN</tt> subqueries are
       now much more efficient
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        In previous releases, <tt class="literal">IN</tt>/<tt class="literal">NOT
        IN</tt> subqueries were joined to the upper query by
        sequentially scanning the subquery looking for a match.  The
        7.4 code uses the same sophisticated techniques used by
        ordinary joins and so is much faster.  An
        <tt class="literal">IN</tt> will now usually be as fast as or faster
        than an equivalent <tt class="literal">EXISTS</tt> subquery; this
        reverses the conventional wisdom that applied to previous
        releases.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Improved <tt class="literal">GROUP BY</tt> processing by using hash buckets
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        In previous releases, rows to be grouped had to be sorted
        first.  The 7.4 code can do <tt class="literal">GROUP BY</tt>
        without sorting, by accumulating results into a hash table
        with one entry per group.  It will still use the sort
        technique, however, if the hash table is estimated to be too
        large to fit in <tt class="varname">sort_mem</tt>.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       New multikey hash join capability
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        In previous releases, hash joins could only occur on single
        keys.  This release allows multicolumn hash joins.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Queries using the explicit <tt class="literal">JOIN</tt> syntax are
       now better optimized
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Prior releases evaluated queries using the explicit
        <tt class="literal">JOIN</tt> syntax only in the order implied by
        the syntax. 7.4 allows full optimization of these queries,
        meaning the optimizer considers all possible join orderings
        and chooses the most efficient.  Outer joins, however, must
        still follow the declared ordering.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Faster and more powerful regular expression code
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The entire regular expression module has been replaced with a
        new version by Henry Spencer, originally written for Tcl.  The
        code greatly improves performance and supports several flavors
        of regular expressions.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Function-inlining for simple SQL functions
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Simple SQL functions can now be inlined by including their SQL
        in the main query.  This improves performance by eliminating
        per-call overhead.  That means simple SQL functions now
        behave like macros.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Full support for IPv6 connections and IPv6 address data types
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Previous releases allowed only IPv4 connections, and the IP
        data types only supported IPv4 addresses. This release adds
        full IPv6 support in both of these areas.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Major improvements in SSL performance and reliability
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Several people very familiar with the SSL API have overhauled
        our SSL code to improve SSL key negotiation and error
        recovery.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Make free space map efficiently reuse empty index pages,
       and other free space management improvements
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        In previous releases, B-tree index pages that were left empty
        because of deleted rows could only be reused by rows with
        index values similar to the rows originally indexed on that
        page. In 7.4, <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> records empty index
        pages and allows them to be reused for any future index rows.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       SQL-standard information schema
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The information schema provides a standardized and stable way
        to access information about the schema objects defined in a
        database.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Cursors conform more closely to the SQL standard
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The commands <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> and
        <tt class="command">MOVE</tt> have been overhauled to conform more
        closely to the SQL standard.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Cursors can exist outside transactions
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        These cursors are also called holdable cursors.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       New client-to-server protocol
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The new protocol adds error codes, more status information,
        faster startup, better support for binary data transmission,
        parameter values separated from SQL commands, prepared
        statements available at the protocol level, and cleaner
        recovery from <tt class="command">COPY</tt> failures.  The older
        protocol is still supported by both server and clients.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       <span class="application">libpq</span> and
       <span class="application">ECPG</span> applications are now fully
       thread-safe
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        While previous <span class="application">libpq</span> releases
        already supported threads, this release improves thread safety
        by fixing some non-thread-safe code that was used during
        database connection startup.  The <tt class="command">configure</tt>
        option <tt class="option">--enable-thread-safety</tt> must be used to
        enable this feature.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       New version of full-text indexing
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        A new full-text indexing suite is available in
        <tt class="filename">contrib/tsearch2</tt>.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       New autovacuum tool
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        The new autovacuum tool in
        <tt class="filename">contrib/autovacuum</tt> monitors the database
        statistics tables for
        <tt class="command">INSERT</tt>/<tt class="command">UPDATE</tt>/<tt class="command">DELETE</tt>
        activity and automatically vacuums tables when needed.
       </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">       Array handling has been improved and moved into the server core
      </span></dt>
<dd><p>        Many array limitations have been removed, and arrays behave
        more like fully-supported data types.

<a name="id2763006"></a>E.8.2. Migration to version 7.4</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>    A dump/restore using <span class="application">pg_dump</span> is
    required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.
   </p>
<p>    Observe the following incompatibilities:

    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>       The server-side autocommit setting was removed and
       reimplemented in client applications and languages.
       Server-side autocommit was causing too many problems with
       languages and applications that wanted to control their own
       autocommit behavior, so autocommit was removed from the server
       and added to individual client APIs as appropriate.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       Error message wording has changed substantially in this
       release.  Significant effort was invested to make the messages
       more consistent and user-oriented.  If your applications try to
       detect different error conditions by parsing the error message,
       you are strongly encouraged to use the new error code facility instead.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       Inner joins using the explicit <tt class="literal">JOIN</tt> syntax
       may behave differently because they are now better
       optimized.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       A number of server configuration parameters have been renamed
       for clarity, primarily those related to
       logging.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       <tt class="literal">FETCH 0</tt> or <tt class="literal">MOVE 0</tt> now
       does nothing.  In prior releases, <tt class="literal">FETCH 0</tt>
       would fetch all remaining rows, and <tt class="literal">MOVE 0</tt>
       would move to the end of the cursor.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> and <tt class="command">MOVE</tt> now return
       the actual number of rows fetched/moved, or zero if at the
       beginning/end of the cursor.  Prior releases would return the
       row count passed to the command, not the number of rows
       actually fetched or moved.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       <tt class="command">COPY</tt> now can process files that use
       carriage-return or carriage-return/line-feed end-of-line
       sequences. Literal carriage-returns and line-feeds are no
       longer accepted in data values; use <tt class="literal">\r</tt> and
       <tt class="literal">\n</tt> instead.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       Trailing spaces are now trimmed when converting from type
       <tt class="type">char(<i class="replaceable"><tt>n</tt></i>)</tt> to
       <tt class="type">varchar(<i class="replaceable"><tt>n</tt></i>)</tt> or <tt class="type">text</tt>.
       This is what most people always expected to happen anyway.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       The data type <tt class="type">float(<i class="replaceable"><tt>p</tt></i>)</tt> now
       measures <i class="replaceable"><tt>p</tt></i> in binary digits, not decimal
       digits.  The new behavior follows the SQL standard.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       Ambiguous date values now must match the ordering specified by
       the <tt class="varname">datestyle</tt> setting.  In prior releases, a
       date specification of <tt class="literal">10/20/03</tt> was interpreted as a
       date in October even if <tt class="varname">datestyle</tt> specified that
       the day should be first.  7.4 will throw an error if a date
       specification is invalid for the current setting of
       <tt class="varname">datestyle</tt>.
      </p></li>
<li><p>       The functions <tt class="function">oidrand</tt>,
       <tt class="function">oidsrand</tt>, and
       <tt class="function">userfntest</tt> have been removed.  These
       functions were determined to be no longer useful.
      </p></li>
<li>
<p>       String literals specifying time-varying date/time values, such
       as <tt class="literal">'now'</tt> or <tt class="literal">'today'</tt> will
       no longer work as expected in column default expressions; they
       now cause the time of the table creation to be the default, not
       the time of the insertion.  Functions such as
       <tt class="function">now()</tt>, <tt class="function">current_timestamp</tt>, or
       <tt class="function">current_date</tt> should be used instead.
      </p>
<p>       In previous releases, there was special code so that strings
       such as <tt class="literal">'now'</tt> were interpreted at
       <tt class="command">INSERT</tt> time and not at table creation time, but
       this work around didn't cover all cases.  Release 7.4 now
       requires that defaults be defined properly using functions such
       as <tt class="function">now()</tt> or <tt class="function">current_timestamp</tt>. These
       will work in all situations.
      </p>
</li>
<li><p>       The dollar sign (<tt class="literal">$</tt>) is no longer allowed in
       operator names.  It can instead be a non-first character in
       identifiers.  This was done to improve compatibility with other
       database systems, and to avoid syntax problems when parameter
       placeholders (<tt class="literal">$<i class="replaceable"><tt>n</tt></i></tt>) are written
       adjacent to operators.

<div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="id2763323"></a>E.8.3.1. Server Operation Changes</h4></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      Allow IPv6 server connections (Nigel Kukard, Johan Jordaan,
      Bruce, Tom, Kurt Roeckx, Andrew Dunstan)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Fix SSL to handle errors cleanly (Nathan Mueller)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, certain SSL API error reports were not
      handled correctly.  This release fixes those problems.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      SSL protocol security and performance improvements (Sean Chittenden)
     </p>
<p>      SSL key renegotiation was happening too frequently, causing poor
      SSL performance.  Also, initial key handling was improved.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Print lock information when a deadlock is detected (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This allows easier debugging of deadlock situations.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Update <tt class="filename">/tmp</tt> socket modification times
      regularly to avoid their removal (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This should help prevent <tt class="filename">/tmp</tt> directory
      cleaner administration scripts from removing server socket
      files.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Enable PAM for Mac OS X (Aaron Hillegass)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Make B-tree indexes fully WAL-safe (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, under certain rare cases, a server crash
      could cause B-tree indexes to become corrupt. This release
      removes those last few rare cases.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow B-tree index compaction and empty page reuse (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>      Fix inconsistent index lookups during split of first root page (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, when a single-page index split into two
      pages, there was a brief period when another database session
      could miss seeing an index entry.  This release fixes that rare
      failure case.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve free space map allocation logic (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Preserve free space information between server restarts (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, the free space map was not saved when the
      postmaster was stopped, so newly started servers had no free
      space information. This release saves the free space map, and
      reloads it when the server is restarted.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Add start time to <tt class="literal">pg_stat_activity</tt> (Neil)</p></li>
<li><p>New code to detect corrupt disk pages; erase with <tt class="varname">zero_damaged_pages</tt> (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>New client/server protocol: faster, no username length limit, allow clean exit from <tt class="command">COPY</tt> (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add transaction status, table ID, column ID to client/server protocol (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add binary I/O to client/server protocol (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove autocommit server setting; move to client applications (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>New error message wording, error codes, and three levels of error detail (Tom, Joe, Peter)</p></li>

<a name="id2763470"></a>E.8.3.2. Performance Improvements</h4></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Add hashing for <tt class="literal">GROUP BY</tt> aggregates (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Make nested-loop joins be smarter about multicolumn indexes (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow multikey hash joins (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve constant folding (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add ability to inline simple SQL functions (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Reduce memory usage for queries using complex functions (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, functions returning allocated memory would
      not free it until the query completed. This release allows the
      freeing of function-allocated memory when the function call
      completes, reducing the total memory used by functions.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve GEQO optimizer performance (Tom)</p>
<p>      This release fixes several inefficiencies in the way the GEQO optimizer
      manages potential query paths.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Allow <tt class="literal">IN</tt>/<tt class="literal">NOT IN</tt> to be handled via hash
      tables (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Improve <tt class="literal">NOT IN (<i class="replaceable"><tt>subquery</tt></i>)</tt>
      performance (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow most <tt class="literal">IN</tt> subqueries to be processed as
      joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Pattern matching operations can use indexes regardless of
      locale (Peter)
     </p>
<p>      There is no way for non-ASCII locales to use the standard
      indexes for <tt class="literal">LIKE</tt> comparisons. This release
      adds a way to create a special index for
      <tt class="literal">LIKE</tt>.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the postmaster to preload libraries using <tt class="varname">preload_libraries</tt> (Joe)</p>
<p>      For shared libraries that require a long time to load, this
      option is available so the library can be preloaded in the
      postmaster and inherited by all database sessions.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Improve optimizer cost computations, particularly for subqueries (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Avoid sort when subquery <tt class="literal">ORDER BY</tt> matches upper query (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Deduce that <tt class="literal">WHERE a.x = b.y AND b.y = 42</tt> also
      means <tt class="literal">a.x = 42</tt> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow hash/merge joins on complex joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow hash joins for more data types (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow join optimization of explicit inner joins, disable with
      <tt class="varname">join_collapse_limit</tt> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Add parameter <tt class="varname">from_collapse_limit</tt> to control
      conversion of subqueries to joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Use faster and more powerful regular expression code from Tcl
      (Henry Spencer, Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Use bit-mapped relation sets in the optimizer (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Improve connection startup time (Tom)</p>
<p>      The new client/server protocol requires fewer network packets to
      start a database session.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Improve trigger/constraint performance (Stephan)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Improve speed of <tt class="literal">col IN (const, const, const, ...)</tt> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Fix hash indexes which were broken in rare cases (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Improve hash index concurrency and speed (Tom)</p>
<p>      Prior releases suffered from poor hash index performance,
      particularly for high concurrency situations. This release fixes
      that, and the development group is interested in reports
      comparing B-tree and hash index performance.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Align shared buffers on 32-byte boundary for copy speed improvement (Manfred Spraul)</p>
<p>      Certain CPU's perform faster data copies when addresses are
      32-byte aligned.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data type <tt class="type">numeric</tt> reimplemented for better performance (Tom)</p>
<p>      <tt class="type">numeric</tt> used to be stored in base 100. The new code
      uses base 10000, for significantly better performance.

<li><p>Rename <tt class="varname">show_*_stats</tt> to <tt class="varname">log_*_stats</tt> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>Rename <tt class="varname">show_source_port</tt> to <tt class="varname">log_source_port</tt> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>Rename <tt class="varname">hostname_lookup</tt> to <tt class="varname">log_hostname</tt> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add <tt class="varname">checkpoint_warning</tt> to warn of excessive checkpointing (Bruce)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, it was difficult to determine if checkpoint
      was happening too frequently. This feature adds a warning to the
      server logs when excessive checkpointing happens.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>New read-only server parameters for localization (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>      Change debug server log messages to output as <tt class="literal">DEBUG</tt>
      rather than <tt class="literal">LOG</tt> (Bruce)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Prevent server log variables from being turned off by non-superusers (Bruce)</p>
<p>      This is a security feature so non-superusers cannot disable
      logging that was enabled by the administrator.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      <tt class="varname">log_min_messages</tt>/<tt class="varname">client_min_messages</tt> now
      controls <tt class="varname">debug_*</tt> output (Bruce)
     </p>
<p>      This centralizes client debug information so all debug output
      can be sent to either the client or server logs.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Mac OS X Rendezvous server support (Chris Campbell)</p>
<p>      This allows Mac OS X hosts to query the network for available
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> servers.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Add ability to print only slow statements using
      <tt class="varname">log_min_duration_statement</tt>
      (Christopher)
     </p>
<p>      This is an often requested debugging feature that allows
      administrators to see only slow queries in their server logs.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow <tt class="filename">pg_hba.conf</tt> to accept netmasks in CIDR format (Andrew Dunstan)</p>
<p>      This allows administrators to merge the host IP address and
      netmask fields into a single CIDR field in <tt class="filename">pg_hba.conf</tt>.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>New read-only parameter <tt class="varname">is_superuser</tt> (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>New parameter <tt class="varname">log_error_verbosity</tt> to control error detail (Tom)</p>
<p>      This works with the new error reporting feature to supply
      additional error information like hints, file names and line
      numbers.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="literal">postgres --describe-config</tt> now dumps server config variables (Aizaz Ahmed, Peter)</p>
<p>      This option is useful for administration tools that need to know
      the configuration variable names and their minimums, maximums,
      defaults, and descriptions.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Add new columns in <tt class="literal">pg_settings</tt>:
      <tt class="literal">context</tt>, <tt class="literal">type</tt>, <tt class="literal">source</tt>,
      <tt class="literal">min_val</tt>, <tt class="literal">max_val</tt> (Joe)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Make default <tt class="varname">shared_buffers</tt> 1000 and
      <tt class="varname">max_connections</tt> 100, if possible (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      Prior versions defaulted to 64 shared buffers so <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      would start on even very old systems. This release tests the
      amount of shared memory allowed by the platform and selects more
      reasonable default values if possible.  Of course, users are
      still encouraged to evaluate their resource load and size
      <tt class="varname">shared_buffers</tt> accordingly.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      New <tt class="filename">pg_hba.conf</tt> record type
      <tt class="literal">hostnossl</tt> to prevent SSL connections (Jon
      Jensen)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, there was no way to prevent SSL connections
      if both the client and server supported SSL. This option allows
      that capability.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Remove parameter <tt class="varname">geqo_random_seed</tt>
      (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Add server parameter <tt class="varname">regex_flavor</tt> to control regular expression processing (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Make <tt class="command">pg_ctl</tt> better handle nonstandard ports (Greg)

<li>
<p>Allow users to see their own queries in <tt class="literal">pg_stat_activity</tt> (Kevin Brown)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, only the superuser could see query strings
      using <tt class="literal">pg_stat_activity</tt>. Now ordinary users
      can see their own query strings.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix aggregates in subqueries to match SQL standard (Tom)</p>
<p>      The SQL standard says that an aggregate function appearing
      within a nested subquery belongs to the outer query if its
      argument contains only outer-query variables.  Prior
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> releases did not handle
      this fine point correctly.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add option to prevent auto-addition of tables referenced in query (Nigel J. Andrews)</p>
<p>      By default, tables mentioned in the query are automatically
      added to the <tt class="literal">FROM</tt> clause if they are not already
      there.  This is compatible with historic
      <span class="productname">POSTGRES</span> behavior but is contrary to
      the SQL standard.  This option allows selecting
      standard-compatible behavior.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow <tt class="literal">UPDATE ... SET col = DEFAULT</tt> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows <tt class="command">UPDATE</tt> to set a column to its
      declared default value.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow expressions to be used in <tt class="literal">LIMIT</tt>/<tt class="literal">OFFSET</tt> (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, <tt class="literal">LIMIT</tt>/<tt class="literal">OFFSET</tt> could
      only use constants, not expressions.
     </p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Make <tt class="command">CREATE SEQUENCE</tt> grammar more conforming to SQL 2003 (Neil)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add statement-level triggers (Neil)</p>
<p>      While this allows a trigger to fire at the end of a statement,
      it does not allow the trigger to access all rows modified by the
      statement.  This capability is planned for a future release.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add check constraints for domains (Rod)</p>
<p>      This greatly increases the usefulness of domains by allowing
      them to use check constraints.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <tt class="command">ALTER DOMAIN</tt> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows manipulation of existing domains.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix several zero-column table bugs (Tom)</p>
<p>      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports zero-column tables. This fixes various bugs
      that occur when using such tables.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have <tt class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY</tt> add not-null constraint (Rod)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, <tt class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... ADD
      PRIMARY</tt> would add a unique index, but not a not-null
      constraint.  That is fixed in this release.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <tt class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... WITHOUT OIDS</tt> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows control over whether new and updated rows will have
      an OID column.  This is most useful for saving storage space.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Add <tt class="literal">ALTER SEQUENCE</tt> to modify minimum, maximum,
      increment, cache, cycle values (Rod)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Add <tt class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON</tt> (Alvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>      This command is used by <tt class="command">pg_dump</tt> to record the
      cluster column for each table previously clustered. This
      information is used by database-wide cluster to cluster all
      previously clustered tables.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve automatic type casting for domains (Rod, Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow dollar signs in identifiers, except as first character (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Disallow dollar signs in operator names, so <tt class="literal">x=$1</tt> works (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>      Allow copying table schema using <tt class="literal">LIKE

<li>
<p>      Add <tt class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</tt> clause to
      <tt class="command">GRANT</tt> (Peter)
     </p>
<p>      This enabled <tt class="command">GRANT</tt> to give other users the

<li>
<p>Add <tt class="literal">ON COMMIT</tt> clause to <tt class="command">CREATE TABLE</tt> for temporary tables (Gavin)</p>
<p>      This adds the ability for a table to be dropped or all rows
      deleted on transaction commit.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow cursors outside transactions using <tt class="literal">WITH HOLD</tt> (Neil)</p>
<p>      In previous releases, cursors were removed at the end of the
      transaction that created them. Cursors can now be created with
      the <tt class="literal">WITH HOLD</tt> option, which allows them to
      continue to be accessed after the creating transaction has
      committed.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="literal">FETCH 0</tt> and <tt class="literal">MOVE 0 </tt> now do nothing (Bruce)</p>
<p>      In previous releases, <tt class="literal">FETCH 0</tt> fetched all
      remaining rows, and <tt class="literal">MOVE 0</tt> moved to the end
      of the cursor.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Cause <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> and <tt class="command">MOVE</tt> to
      return the number of rows fetched/moved, or zero if at the
      beginning/end of cursor, per SQL standard (Bruce)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, the row count returned by
      <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> and <tt class="command">MOVE</tt> did not
      accurately reflect the number of rows processed.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly handle <tt class="literal">SCROLL</tt> with cursors, or
     report an error (Neil)</p>
<p>      Allowing random access (both forward and backward scrolling) to
      some kinds of queries cannot be done without some additional
      work. If <tt class="literal">SCROLL</tt> is specified when the cursor
      is created, this additional work will be performed. Furthermore,
      if the cursor has been created with <tt class="literal">NO SCROLL</tt>,
      no random access is allowed.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Implement SQL-compatible options <tt class="literal">FIRST</tt>,

<li><p>Allow <tt class="command">EXPLAIN</tt> on <tt class="command">DECLARE CURSOR</tt> (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow <tt class="command">CLUSTER</tt> to use index marked as pre-clustered by default (Alvaro Herrera)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Allow <tt class="command">CLUSTER</tt> to cluster all tables (Alvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>      This allows all previously clustered tables in a database to be
      reclustered with a single command.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevent <tt class="command">CLUSTER</tt> on partial indexes (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow DOS and Mac line-endings in <tt class="command">COPY</tt> files (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>      Disallow literal carriage return as a data value,
      backslash-carriage-return and <tt class="literal">\r</tt> are still allowed

<li><p>Recover from <tt class="command">COPY</tt> failure cleanly (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent possible memory leaks in <tt class="command">COPY</tt> (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Make <tt class="command">TRUNCATE</tt> transaction-safe (Rod)</p>
<p>      <tt class="command">TRUNCATE</tt> can now be used inside a
      transaction. If the transaction aborts, the changes made by the
      <tt class="command">TRUNCATE</tt> are automatically rolled back.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Allow prepare/bind of utility commands like
      <tt class="command">FETCH</tt> and <tt class="command">EXPLAIN</tt> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>Add <tt class="command">EXPLAIN EXECUTE</tt> (Neil)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve <tt class="command">VACUUM</tt> performance on indexes by reducing WAL traffic (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Functional indexes have been generalized into indexes on expressions (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, functional indexes only supported a simple
      function applied to one or more column names.  This release
      allows any type of scalar expression.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Have <tt class="command">SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION</tt> match input
      to <tt class="command">SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION</tt>

     </p></li>
<li>
<p>       Have <tt class="command">COMMENT ON DATABASE</tt> on nonlocal
       database generate a warning, rather than an error (Rod)
      </p>
<p>      Database comments are stored in database-local tables so
      comments on a database have to be stored in each database.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Improve reliability of <tt class="command">LISTEN</tt>/<tt class="command">NOTIFY</tt> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Allow <tt class="command">REINDEX</tt> to reliably reindex nonshared system catalog indexes (Tom)</p>
<p>      This allows system tables to be reindexed without the
      requirement of a standalone session, which was necessary in
      previous releases. The only tables that now require a standalone
      session for reindexing are the global system tables
      <tt class="literal">pg_database</tt>, <tt class="literal">pg_shadow</tt>, and
      <tt class="literal">pg_group</tt>.
