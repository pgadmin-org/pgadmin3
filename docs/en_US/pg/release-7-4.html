<p>    Major changes in this release:
   </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">      <code class="literal">IN</code> / <code class="literal">NOT IN</code> subqueries are
      now much more efficient
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       In previous releases, <code class="literal">IN</code>/<code class="literal">NOT
       IN</code> subqueries were joined to the upper query by
       sequentially scanning the subquery looking for a match.  The
       7.4 code uses the same sophisticated techniques used by
       ordinary joins and so is much faster.  An
       <code class="literal">IN</code> will now usually be as fast as or faster
       than an equivalent <code class="literal">EXISTS</code> subquery; this
       reverses the conventional wisdom that applied to previous
       releases.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Improved <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> processing by using hash buckets
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       In previous releases, rows to be grouped had to be sorted
       first.  The 7.4 code can do <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code>
       without sorting, by accumulating results into a hash table
       with one entry per group.  It will still use the sort
       technique, however, if the hash table is estimated to be too
       large to fit in <code class="varname">sort_mem</code>.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      New multikey hash join capability
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       In previous releases, hash joins could only occur on single
       keys.  This release allows multicolumn hash joins.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Queries using the explicit <code class="literal">JOIN</code> syntax are
      now better optimized
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Prior releases evaluated queries using the explicit
       <code class="literal">JOIN</code> syntax only in the order implied by
       the syntax. 7.4 allows full optimization of these queries,
       meaning the optimizer considers all possible join orderings
       and chooses the most efficient.  Outer joins, however, must
       still follow the declared ordering.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Faster and more powerful regular expression code
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       The entire regular expression module has been replaced with a
       new version by Henry Spencer, originally written for Tcl.  The
       code greatly improves performance and supports several flavors
       of regular expressions.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Function-inlining for simple SQL functions
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Simple SQL functions can now be inlined by including their SQL
       in the main query.  This improves performance by eliminating
       per-call overhead.  That means simple SQL functions now
       behave like macros.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Full support for IPv6 connections and IPv6 address data types
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Previous releases allowed only IPv4 connections, and the IP
       data types only supported IPv4 addresses. This release adds
       full IPv6 support in both of these areas.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Major improvements in SSL performance and reliability
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Several people very familiar with the SSL API have overhauled
       our SSL code to improve SSL key negotiation and error
       recovery.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Make free space map efficiently reuse empty index pages,
      and other free space management improvements
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       In previous releases, B-tree index pages that were left empty
       because of deleted rows could only be reused by rows with
       index values similar to the rows originally indexed on that
       page. In 7.4, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> records empty index
       pages and allows them to be reused for any future index rows.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      SQL-standard information schema
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       The information schema provides a standardized and stable way
       to access information about the schema objects defined in a
       database.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Cursors conform more closely to the SQL standard
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       The commands <code class="command">FETCH</code> and
       <code class="command">MOVE</code> have been overhauled to conform more
       closely to the SQL standard.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Cursors can exist outside transactions
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       These cursors are also called holdable cursors.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      New client-to-server protocol
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       The new protocol adds error codes, more status information,
       faster startup, better support for binary data transmission,
       parameter values separated from SQL commands, prepared
       statements available at the protocol level, and cleaner
       recovery from <code class="command">COPY</code> failures.  The older
       protocol is still supported by both server and clients.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      <span class="application">libpq</span> and
      <span class="application">ECPG</span> applications are now fully
      thread-safe
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       While previous <span class="application">libpq</span> releases
       already supported threads, this release improves thread safety
       by fixing some non-thread-safe code that was used during
       database connection startup.  The <code class="command">configure</code>
       option <code class="option">--enable-thread-safety</code> must be used to
       enable this feature.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      New version of full-text indexing
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       A new full-text indexing suite is available in
       <code class="filename">contrib/tsearch2</code>.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      New autovacuum tool
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       The new autovacuum tool in
       <code class="filename">contrib/autovacuum</code> monitors the database
       statistics tables for
       <code class="command">INSERT</code>/<code class="command">UPDATE</code>/<code class="command">DELETE</code>
       activity and automatically vacuums tables when needed.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">      Array handling has been improved and moved into the server core
     </span></dt>
<dd><p>       Many array limitations have been removed, and arrays behave
       more like fully-supported data types.
      </p></dd>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id2866687">E.45.2. Migration to version 7.4</h3></div></div></div>
<p>    A dump/restore using <span class="application">pg_dump</span> is
    required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous
    release.
   </p>
<p>    Observe the following incompatibilities:
   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      The server-side autocommit setting was removed and
      reimplemented in client applications and languages.
      Server-side autocommit was causing too many problems with
      languages and applications that wanted to control their own
      autocommit behavior, so autocommit was removed from the server
      and added to individual client APIs as appropriate.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Error message wording has changed substantially in this
      release.  Significant effort was invested to make the messages
      more consistent and user-oriented.  If your applications try to
      detect different error conditions by parsing the error message,
      you are strongly encouraged to use the new error code facility instead.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Inner joins using the explicit <code class="literal">JOIN</code> syntax
      might behave differently because they are now better
      optimized.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      A number of server configuration parameters have been renamed
      for clarity, primarily those related to
      logging.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      <code class="literal">FETCH 0</code> or <code class="literal">MOVE 0</code> now
      does nothing.  In prior releases, <code class="literal">FETCH 0</code>
      would fetch all remaining rows, and <code class="literal">MOVE 0</code>
      would move to the end of the cursor.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      <code class="command">FETCH</code> and <code class="command">MOVE</code> now return
      the actual number of rows fetched/moved, or zero if at the
      beginning/end of the cursor.  Prior releases would return the
      row count passed to the command, not the number of rows
      actually fetched or moved.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      <code class="command">COPY</code> now can process files that use
      carriage-return or carriage-return/line-feed end-of-line
      sequences. Literal carriage-returns and line-feeds are no
      longer accepted in data values; use <code class="literal">\r</code> and
      <code class="literal">\n</code> instead.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Trailing spaces are now trimmed when converting from type
      <code class="type">char(<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>)</code> to
      <code class="type">varchar(<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>)</code> or <code class="type">text</code>.
      This is what most people always expected to happen anyway.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      The data type <code class="type">float(<em class="replaceable"><code>p</code></em>)</code> now
      measures <em class="replaceable"><code>p</code></em> in binary digits, not decimal
      digits.  The new behavior follows the SQL standard.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Ambiguous date values now must match the ordering specified by
      the <code class="varname">datestyle</code> setting.  In prior releases, a
      date specification of <code class="literal">10/20/03</code> was interpreted as a
      date in October even if <code class="varname">datestyle</code> specified that
      the day should be first.  7.4 will throw an error if a date
      specification is invalid for the current setting of
      <code class="varname">datestyle</code>.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      The functions <code class="function">oidrand</code>,
      <code class="function">oidsrand</code>, and
      <code class="function">userfntest</code> have been removed.  These
      functions were determined to be no longer useful.
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      String literals specifying time-varying date/time values, such
      as <code class="literal">'now'</code> or <code class="literal">'today'</code> will
      no longer work as expected in column default expressions; they
      now cause the time of the table creation to be the default, not
      the time of the insertion.  Functions such as
      <code class="function">now()</code>, <code class="function">current_timestamp</code>, or
      <code class="function">current_date</code> should be used instead.
     </p>
<p>      In previous releases, there was special code so that strings
      such as <code class="literal">'now'</code> were interpreted at
      <code class="command">INSERT</code> time and not at table creation time, but
      this work around didn't cover all cases.  Release 7.4 now
      requires that defaults be defined properly using functions such
      as <code class="function">now()</code> or <code class="function">current_timestamp</code>. These
      will work in all situations.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      The dollar sign (<code class="literal">$</code>) is no longer allowed in
      operator names.  It can instead be a non-first character in
      identifiers.  This was done to improve compatibility with other
      database systems, and to avoid syntax problems when parameter
      placeholders (<code class="literal">$<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em></code>) are written
      adjacent to operators.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="id2867001">E.45.3.1. Server Operation Changes</h4></div></div></div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>      Allow IPv6 server connections (Nigel Kukard, Johan Jordaan,
      Bruce, Tom, Kurt Roeckx, Andrew Dunstan)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Fix SSL to handle errors cleanly (Nathan Mueller)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, certain SSL API error reports were not
      handled correctly.  This release fixes those problems.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      SSL protocol security and performance improvements (Sean Chittenden)
     </p>
<p>      SSL key renegotiation was happening too frequently, causing poor
      SSL performance.  Also, initial key handling was improved.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Print lock information when a deadlock is detected (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This allows easier debugging of deadlock situations.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Update <code class="filename">/tmp</code> socket modification times
      regularly to avoid their removal (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      This should help prevent <code class="filename">/tmp</code> directory
      cleaner administration scripts from removing server socket
      files.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Enable PAM for Mac OS X (Aaron Hillegass)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Make B-tree indexes fully WAL-safe (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, under certain rare cases, a server crash
      could cause B-tree indexes to become corrupt. This release
      removes those last few rare cases.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow B-tree index compaction and empty page reuse (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>      Fix inconsistent index lookups during split of first root page (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, when a single-page index split into two
      pages, there was a brief period when another database session
      could miss seeing an index entry.  This release fixes that rare
      failure case.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve free space map allocation logic (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Preserve free space information between server restarts (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, the free space map was not saved when the
      postmaster was stopped, so newly started servers had no free
      space information. This release saves the free space map, and
      reloads it when the server is restarted.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Add start time to <code class="literal">pg_stat_activity</code> (Neil)</p></li>
<li><p>New code to detect corrupt disk pages; erase with <code class="varname">zero_damaged_pages</code> (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>New client/server protocol: faster, no username length limit, allow clean exit from <code class="command">COPY</code> (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add transaction status, table ID, column ID to client/server protocol (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add binary I/O to client/server protocol (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove autocommit server setting; move to client applications (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>New error message wording, error codes, and three levels of error detail (Tom, Joe, Peter)</p></li>

<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="id2867148">E.45.3.2. Performance Improvements</h4></div></div></div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Add hashing for <code class="literal">GROUP BY</code> aggregates (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Make nested-loop joins be smarter about multicolumn indexes (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow multikey hash joins (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve constant folding (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Add ability to inline simple SQL functions (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Reduce memory usage for queries using complex functions (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, functions returning allocated memory would
      not free it until the query completed. This release allows the
      freeing of function-allocated memory when the function call
      completes, reducing the total memory used by functions.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve GEQO optimizer performance (Tom)</p>
<p>      This release fixes several inefficiencies in the way the GEQO optimizer
      manages potential query paths.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Allow <code class="literal">IN</code>/<code class="literal">NOT IN</code> to be handled via hash
      tables (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Improve <code class="literal">NOT IN (<em class="replaceable"><code>subquery</code></em>)</code>
      performance (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow most <code class="literal">IN</code> subqueries to be processed as
      joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Pattern matching operations can use indexes regardless of
      locale (Peter)
     </p>
<p>      There is no way for non-ASCII locales to use the standard
      indexes for <code class="literal">LIKE</code> comparisons. This release
      adds a way to create a special index for
      <code class="literal">LIKE</code>.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the postmaster to preload libraries using <code class="varname">preload_libraries</code> (Joe)</p>
<p>      For shared libraries that require a long time to load, this
      option is available so the library can be preloaded in the
      postmaster and inherited by all database sessions.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Improve optimizer cost computations, particularly for subqueries (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Avoid sort when subquery <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> matches upper query (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Deduce that <code class="literal">WHERE a.x = b.y AND b.y = 42</code> also
      means <code class="literal">a.x = 42</code> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow hash/merge joins on complex joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow hash joins for more data types (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Allow join optimization of explicit inner joins, disable with
      <code class="varname">join_collapse_limit</code> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Add parameter <code class="varname">from_collapse_limit</code> to control
      conversion of subqueries to joins (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Use faster and more powerful regular expression code from Tcl
      (Henry Spencer, Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Use bit-mapped relation sets in the optimizer (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Improve connection startup time (Tom)</p>
<p>      The new client/server protocol requires fewer network packets to
      start a database session.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Improve trigger/constraint performance (Stephan)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Improve speed of <code class="literal">col IN (const, const, const, ...)</code> (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Fix hash indexes which were broken in rare cases (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Improve hash index concurrency and speed (Tom)</p>
<p>      Prior releases suffered from poor hash index performance,
      particularly for high concurrency situations. This release fixes
      that, and the development group is interested in reports
      comparing B-tree and hash index performance.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Align shared buffers on 32-byte boundary for copy speed improvement (Manfred Spraul)</p>
<p>      Certain CPU's perform faster data copies when addresses are
      32-byte aligned.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data type <code class="type">numeric</code> reimplemented for better performance (Tom)</p>
<p>      <code class="type">numeric</code> used to be stored in base 100. The new code
      uses base 10000, for significantly better performance.

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Rename server parameter <code class="varname">server_min_messages</code> to <code class="varname">log_min_messages</code> (Bruce)</p>
<p>      This was done so most parameters that control the server logs
      begin with <code class="literal">log_</code>.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Rename <code class="varname">show_*_stats</code> to <code class="varname">log_*_stats</code> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>Rename <code class="varname">show_source_port</code> to <code class="varname">log_source_port</code> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>Rename <code class="varname">hostname_lookup</code> to <code class="varname">log_hostname</code> (Bruce)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add <code class="varname">checkpoint_warning</code> to warn of excessive checkpointing (Bruce)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, it was difficult to determine if checkpoint
      was happening too frequently. This feature adds a warning to the
      server logs when excessive checkpointing happens.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>New read-only server parameters for localization (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>      Change debug server log messages to output as <code class="literal">DEBUG</code>
      rather than <code class="literal">LOG</code> (Bruce)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Prevent server log variables from being turned off by non-superusers (Bruce)</p>
<p>      This is a security feature so non-superusers cannot disable
      logging that was enabled by the administrator.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      <code class="varname">log_min_messages</code>/<code class="varname">client_min_messages</code> now
      controls <code class="varname">debug_*</code> output (Bruce)
     </p>
<p>      This centralizes client debug information so all debug output
      can be sent to either the client or server logs.

<p>Add Mac OS X Rendezvous server support (Chris Campbell)</p>
<p>      This allows Mac OS X hosts to query the network for available
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> servers.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Add ability to print only slow statements using
      <code class="varname">log_min_duration_statement</code>
      (Christopher)
     </p>
<p>      This is an often requested debugging feature that allows
      administrators to see only slow queries in their server logs.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> to accept netmasks in CIDR format (Andrew Dunstan)</p>
<p>      This allows administrators to merge the host IP address and
      netmask fields into a single CIDR field in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>New read-only parameter <code class="varname">is_superuser</code> (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>New parameter <code class="varname">log_error_verbosity</code> to control error detail (Tom)</p>
<p>      This works with the new error reporting feature to supply
      additional error information like hints, file names and line
      numbers.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="literal">postgres --describe-config</code> now dumps server config variables (Aizaz Ahmed, Peter)</p>
<p>      This option is useful for administration tools that need to know
      the configuration variable names and their minimums, maximums,
      defaults, and descriptions.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Add new columns in <code class="literal">pg_settings</code>:
      <code class="literal">context</code>, <code class="literal">type</code>, <code class="literal">source</code>,
      <code class="literal">min_val</code>, <code class="literal">max_val</code> (Joe)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>      Make default <code class="varname">shared_buffers</code> 1000 and
      <code class="varname">max_connections</code> 100, if possible (Tom)
     </p>
<p>      Prior versions defaulted to 64 shared buffers so <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      would start on even very old systems. This release tests the
      amount of shared memory allowed by the platform and selects more
      reasonable default values if possible.  Of course, users are
      still encouraged to evaluate their resource load and size
      <code class="varname">shared_buffers</code> accordingly.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      New <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> record type
      <code class="literal">hostnossl</code> to prevent SSL connections (Jon
      Jensen)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, there was no way to prevent SSL connections
      if both the client and server supported SSL. This option allows
      that capability.
     </p>

<li><p>      Remove parameter <code class="varname">geqo_random_seed</code>
      (Tom)

      can see their own query strings.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix aggregates in subqueries to match SQL standard (Tom)</p>
<p>      The SQL standard says that an aggregate function appearing
      within a nested subquery belongs to the outer query if its
      argument contains only outer-query variables.  Prior
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> releases did not handle
      this fine point correctly.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add option to prevent auto-addition of tables referenced in query (Nigel J. Andrews)</p>
<p>      By default, tables mentioned in the query are automatically
      added to the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause if they are not already
      there.  This is compatible with historic
      <span class="productname">POSTGRES</span> behavior but is contrary to
      the SQL standard.  This option allows selecting
      standard-compatible behavior.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow <code class="literal">UPDATE ... SET col = DEFAULT</code> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows <code class="command">UPDATE</code> to set a column to its

     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow expressions to be used in <code class="literal">LIMIT</code>/<code class="literal">OFFSET</code> (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, <code class="literal">LIMIT</code>/<code class="literal">OFFSET</code> could

<li>
<p>Add statement-level triggers (Neil)</p>
<p>      While this allows a trigger to fire at the end of a statement,
      it does not allow the trigger to access all rows modified by the
      statement.  This capability is planned for a future release.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add check constraints for domains (Rod)</p>
<p>      This greatly increases the usefulness of domains by allowing
      them to use check constraints.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code class="command">ALTER DOMAIN</code> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows manipulation of existing domains.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix several zero-column table bugs (Tom)</p>
<p>      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> supports zero-column tables. This fixes various bugs
      that occur when using such tables.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY</code> add not-null constraint (Rod)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... ADD
      PRIMARY</code> would add a unique index, but not a not-null
      constraint.  That is fixed in this release.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... WITHOUT OIDS</code> (Rod)</p>
<p>      This allows control over whether new and updated rows will have
      an OID column.  This is most useful for saving storage space.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Add <code class="literal">ALTER SEQUENCE</code> to modify minimum, maximum,
      increment, cache, cycle values (Rod)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>Add <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON</code> (Alvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>      This command is used by <code class="command">pg_dump</code> to record the
      cluster column for each table previously clustered. This
      information is used by database-wide cluster to cluster all
      previously clustered tables.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>Improve automatic type casting for domains (Rod, Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow dollar signs in identifiers, except as first character (Tom)</p></li>

<li>
<p>Add <code class="literal">ON COMMIT</code> clause to <code class="command">CREATE TABLE</code> for temporary tables (Gavin)</p>
<p>      This adds the ability for a table to be dropped or all rows
      deleted on transaction commit.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow cursors outside transactions using <code class="literal">WITH HOLD</code> (Neil)</p>
<p>      In previous releases, cursors were removed at the end of the
      transaction that created them. Cursors can now be created with
      the <code class="literal">WITH HOLD</code> option, which allows them to
      continue to be accessed after the creating transaction has
      committed.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="literal">FETCH 0</code> and <code class="literal">MOVE 0 </code> now do nothing (Bruce)</p>
<p>      In previous releases, <code class="literal">FETCH 0</code> fetched all
      remaining rows, and <code class="literal">MOVE 0</code> moved to the end
      of the cursor.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>      Cause <code class="command">FETCH</code> and <code class="command">MOVE</code> to
      return the number of rows fetched/moved, or zero if at the
      beginning/end of cursor, per SQL standard (Bruce)
     </p>
<p>      In prior releases, the row count returned by
      <code class="command">FETCH</code> and <code class="command">MOVE</code> did not
      accurately reflect the number of rows processed.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly handle <code class="literal">SCROLL</code> with cursors, or
     report an error (Neil)</p>
<p>      Allowing random access (both forward and backward scrolling) to
      some kinds of queries cannot be done without some additional
      work. If <code class="literal">SCROLL</code> is specified when the cursor
      is created, this additional work will be performed. Furthermore,
      if the cursor has been created with <code class="literal">NO SCROLL</code>,
      no random access is allowed.

<li><p>      Implement SQL-compatible options <code class="literal">FIRST</code>,

<li><p>Prevent <code class="command">CLUSTER</code> on partial indexes (Tom)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow DOS and Mac line-endings in <code class="command">COPY</code> files (Bruce)</p></li>
<li><p>      Disallow literal carriage return as a data value,

<li>
<p>Make <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> transaction-safe (Rod)</p>
<p>      <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> can now be used inside a
      transaction. If the transaction aborts, the changes made by the
      <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> are automatically rolled back.
     </p>

<li><p>      Allow prepare/bind of utility commands like
      <code class="command">FETCH</code> and <code class="command">EXPLAIN</code> (Tom)

<li><p>Add <code class="command">EXPLAIN EXECUTE</code> (Neil)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve <code class="command">VACUUM</code> performance on indexes by reducing WAL traffic (Tom)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Functional indexes have been generalized into indexes on expressions (Tom)</p>
<p>      In prior releases, functional indexes only supported a simple
      function applied to one or more column names.  This release
      allows any type of scalar expression.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Have <code class="command">SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION</code> match input
      to <code class="command">SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION</code>
      (Tom)
     </p></li>
<li>
<p>       Have <code class="command">COMMENT ON DATABASE</code> on nonlocal
       database generate a warning, rather than an error (Rod)
      </p>
<p>      Database comments are stored in database-local tables so
      comments on a database have to be stored in each database.

<li>
<p>Allow <code class="command">REINDEX</code> to reliably reindex nonshared system catalog indexes (Tom)</p>
<p>      This allows system tables to be reindexed without the
      requirement of a standalone session, which was necessary in
      previous releases. The only tables that now require a standalone
      session for reindexing are the global system tables
