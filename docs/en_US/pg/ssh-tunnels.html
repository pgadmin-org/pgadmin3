<a name="id2592324"></a><p>   One can use <span class="application">SSH</span> to encrypt the network
   connection between clients and a
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server. Done properly, this
   provides an adequately secure network connection, even for non-SSL-capable
   clients.
  </p>
<p>   First make sure that an <span class="application">SSH</span> server is
   running properly on the same machine as the
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server and that you can log in using
   <tt class="command">ssh</tt> as some user. Then you can establish a secure
   tunnel with a command like this from the client machine:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">ssh -L 3333:foo.com:5432 joe@foo.com</pre>
<p>
   The first number in the <tt class="option">-L</tt> argument, 3333, is the
   port number of your end of the tunnel; it can be chosen freely. The
   second number, 5432, is the remote end of the tunnel: the port
   number your server is using. The name or IP address between
   the port numbers is the host with the database server you are going
   to connect to. In order to connect to the database server using
   this tunnel, you connect to port 3333 on the local machine:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">psql -h localhost -p 3333 template1</pre>
<p>
   To the database server it will then look as though you are really
   user <tt class="literal">joe@foo.com</tt> and it will use whatever
   authentication procedure was configured for connections from this
   user and host.  Note that the server will not think the connection is
   SSL-encrypted, since in fact it is not encrypted between the
   <span class="application">SSH</span> server and the
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server.  This should not pose any
   extra security risk as long as they are on the same machine.
  </p>
<p>   In order for the
   tunnel setup to succeed you must be allowed to connect via
   <tt class="command">ssh</tt> as <tt class="literal">joe@foo.com</tt>, just
   as if you had attempted to use <tt class="command">ssh</tt> to set up a
   terminal session.

<h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
<p>    Several other applications exist that can provide secure tunnels using
    a procedure similar in concept to the one just described.
