<h3>Extended features</h3>

<p>pgAdmin III's functionality can be further enhanced using the <I>admin</I> contrib
module for PostgreSQL. This is a library of additional functions that may be installed 
on your server which allows pgAdmin to offer additional features, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>The sizes on disk of tablespaces, databases, tables and indexes are
displayed on the Statistics tab in the <a href="main.html">main window</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The <a href="status.html">Status dialogue</A> will have the logfile
tab and can display the server logfiles if it is configured.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Running queries from other users may be cancelled from the 
<a href="status.html">Status dialogue</A>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The server's configuration files postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf
may be editted, and reloaded remotely.<br>&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p>The <I>admin</I> module is installed and activated by default if you are running the 
'official' pgInstaller distribution of PostgreSQL for Windows, however, if you are running
any other version of PostgreSQL you will need to manually install the module. To do so,
simply copy the /xtra/admin directory from the pgAdmin source distribution to the /contrib
directory of your pre-configured PostgreSQL source tree. Run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
    # cd $PGSRC/contrib/admin
    # make all
    # make install
</pre>

<p>The module should now be built, and installed into your existing PostgreSQL installation.
to be used, you must now install the module into the database you use as pgAdmin's <I>Initial
DB</I> (normally template1, though you may wish to use a different database). To do so, 
locate the admin.sql file installed in the previous step - normally this may be found in 
/usr/local/pgsql/share/contrib/ and run it against your database. You will normally need to do
this as the PostgreSQL superuser:</p>

<pre>
    $ psql template1 < /usr/local/pgsql/share/contrib/admin.sql
</pre>

<p>The next time you connect to the server with pgAdmin, it will detect the presence of the <I>admin</I>
module and offer full functionality.</p>
