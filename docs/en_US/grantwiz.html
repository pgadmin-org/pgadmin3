<h3>Grant Wizard</h3>

<center><img src="images/grantwiz.png"></center>

<p>
The Grant Wizard allows assignment of a set of privileges to groups and users to
multiple objects (tables, sequences, views and functions) in a convenient way.
</p>
<p>
The Selection tab will show all applicable objects under the currently selected object.
Check all objects you like to grant privileges on.
<p>
The security tab defines the privileges and groups/users that should be granted. Assigning 
no privileges to a group or user will result in revoking all rights for them.
</p>
<p>
The SQL tab shows the sql commands that are generated from the selected grant targets.
</p>
<p>
When clicking OK, the sql commands will be executed; any result will be displayed in the 
Messages tab.
