<h3>VACUUM FULL</h3>
<p>
VACUUM FULL is not recommended for PostgreSQL versions prior to 9.0, except
in extreme circumstances.
</p>
<p>
VACUUM FULL should only be used if large amounts of data have been updated
or deleted in a table, in order to release space back to the operating system.
In cases where the space can be expected to be used by the table in the future,
a regular VACUUM should be used instead.
</p>
<p>
VACUUM FULL will take exclusive locks in the database, preventing
<i>all</i> other activity on the table(s) being VACUUMed, and as such will
have a very large impact on other users of the database while it runs.
</p>
<p>
After a table or database has been VACUUM FULL'ed, it is recommended to
REINDEX all indexes on the table as well.
