   the HTML format help files, or the path to a Compiled HTML Help (.chm) file (on
   Windows), an HTML Help project (.hhp) file, or a Zip archive containing the HTML

   to the Slony help files. This may be a URL or directory containing
   the HTML format help files, or the path to a Compiled HTML Help (.chm) file (on

   by declaring them a system schema. This field takes a list of comma separated strings.<br>&nbsp;</li> 
   
   <li><b>Slony-I path</b>- To enable pgAdmin III to create Slony-I replication clusters
   from scratch, you need to enter the path to the Slony-I script installation directory here. If no
   valid scripts can be found, only joining existing clusters is possible.

   and pg_dumpall utilities. pgAdmin will use these for backing up and restoring your PostgreSQL databases.
   If this path is not set, pgAdmin will attempt to find the utilities in it's installation directory,
   the 'hint' directory set by a local PostgreSQL installation (on Windows) and in the system path.
   <br>&nbsp;</li>

   <li><b>EDB bin path</b>- This should be set to the path to the EnterpriseDB pg_dump, pg_restore
   and pg_dumpall utilities. pgAdmin will use these for backing up and restoring your EnterpriseDB databases.
   If this path is not set, pgAdmin will attempt to find the utilities in standard locations used by
   EnterpriseDB.
