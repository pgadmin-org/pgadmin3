<H3>pgAgent Steps</H3>
<P>Each Job consists of a number of steps, each of which may be an SQL script,
or an operating system batch/shell script. Each step in a given job is run in 
turn, in alphanumeric name order.</P>

<P>Steps may be added to a job through the job properties dialogue, or added
as a sub-object. The <I>Properties</I> tab of the main pgAdmin window will display 
details of the selected step, and the <I>Statistics</I> tab will display details
of each run of the step, including and output or errors from the script.</P>

<P>Each step consists of the details shown on the screenshot below, most of
which are self-explanatory. If <I>Kind</I> is set to SQL, then it goes without
saying that a database against which to run the script must be selected. If 
set to <I>Batch</I>, the database should be left blank. The <I>On Error</I> option 
controls how failure of this step will affect the
status of the overall job.</P>

<P>The <I>Definition</I> tab contains a single text box into which the step
script should be entered. For SQL steps, this should be a series of one or more
SQL statements. For batch jobs, when running on a Windows server, standard
batch file syntax must be used, and when running on a *nix server, any shell
script may be used, provided that a suitable interpreter is specified on the
first line (e.g. <I>#!/bin/sh</I>).</P>
