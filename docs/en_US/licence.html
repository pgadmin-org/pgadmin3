<H3>The Artistic Licence</H3>
<P>Preamble</P>
<P>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which
a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains
some semblance of artistic control over the development of the
package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and
distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the
right to make reasonable modifications.</P>
<P>Definitions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Package&quot; refers to the
	collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
	derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
	modification. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Standard Version&quot;
	refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
	modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is
	whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;You&quot; is you, if you're
	thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot;
	is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
	charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
	required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
	computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for
	the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the
	item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form
of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
associated disclaimers.</P>
<P>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered
the Standard Version.</P>
<P>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or
otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by
allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation
or organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do
not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided,
and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>d) make other distribution arrangements with the
Copyright Holder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code
or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and
library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable
source of the Package with your modifications.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their
corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard
executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the
differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>d) make other distribution arrangements with the
Copyright Holder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
as a product of your own.</P>
<P>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced
as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.</P>
<P>7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package.</P>
<P>8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.</P>
<P>9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.</P>
