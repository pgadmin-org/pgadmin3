<p> <span class="productname">Frotznik Freenix</span> is new to
me, so it's a bit dangerous to give really hard-and-fast definitive
answers.  </p>
<p> The answers differ somewhat between the various combinations of
<span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> and <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> versions; the newer versions generally
somewhat easier to cope with than are the older versions.  In general,
you almost certainly need to compile <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> from sources; depending
on versioning of both <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> and <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, you
<span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> need to compile <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> from scratch.
(Whether you need to <span class="emphasis"><em> use </em></span> the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> compile
is another matter; you probably don't...) </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.0.5 and earlier require having a
fully configured copy of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> sources available when you compile
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.</p>
<p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Hopefully</em></span> you can make the configuration
this closely match against the configuration in use by the packaged
version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> by checking the configuration using the command
<code class="command"> pg_config --configure</code>. </p>
</li>
<li><p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> version 1.1 simplifies this considerably;
it does not require the full copy of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> sources, but can,
instead, refer to the various locations where <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> libraries,
binaries, configuration, and <code class="command"> #include </code> files are
located.  </p></li>
<li>
<p> <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0 and higher is generally easier to deal
with in that a &#8220;<span class="quote">default</span>&#8221; installation includes all of the
<code class="command"> #include </code> files.  </p>
<p> If you are using an earlier version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, you may find
it necessary to resort to a source installation if the packaged
version did not install the &#8220;<span class="quote">server
<code class="command">#include</code></span>&#8221; files, which are installed by the
command <code class="command"> make install-all-headers </code>.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p> In effect, the &#8220;<span class="quote">worst case</span>&#8221; scenario takes place
if you are using a version of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> earlier than 1.1 with an
&#8220;<span class="quote">elderly</span>&#8221; version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, in which case you can
expect to need to compile <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> from scratch in order to have
everything that the <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> compile needs even though you are using a
&#8220;<span class="quote">packaged</span>&#8221; version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>.</p>
<p> If you are running a recent <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> and a recent <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>,
then the codependencies can be fairly small, and you may not need
extra <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> sources.  These improvements should ease the
production of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> packages so that you might soon even be able to
hope to avoid compiling <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, replication suddenly stopped to node 3.</p>
<p>The problem was that there was not a suitable set of
&#8220;<span class="quote">listener paths</span>&#8221; in <a href="table.sl-listen.html" title="1.4.  Table: sl_listen">sl_listen</a> to allow the events from

<p>The following slonik script dropped out the listen paths where

  drop listen (origin = 3, receiver = 1, provider = 2);

<p>The &#8220;<span class="quote">event listening</span>&#8221; threads are no big deal; they

shut off the <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> during an event, the transaction

is if the <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> runs fairly distant from nodes that it connects to;

<p> Actually, this is a scenario which works out remarkably
cleanly.  <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does indeed make intense use of the primary key
columns, but actually does so in a manner that allows this sort of
change to be made very nearly transparently.</p>
<p> Suppose you revise a column name, as with the SQL DDL <code class="command">alter table accounts alter column aid rename to cid; </code> This
revises the names of the columns in the table; it
<span class="emphasis"><em>simultaneously</em></span> renames the names of the columns
in the primary key index.  The result is that the normal course of
things is that altering a column name affects both aspects
simultaneously on a given node.</p>
<p> The <span class="emphasis"><em>ideal</em></span> and proper handling of this
change would involve using <a href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a> to deploy
the alteration, which ensures it is applied at exactly the right point
in the transaction stream on each node.</p>
<p> Interestingly, that isn't forcibly necessary.  As long as the
alteration is applied on the replication set's origin before
application on subscribers, things won't break irrepairably.  Some
<code class="command">SYNC</code> events that do not include changes to the
altered table can make it through without any difficulty...  At the
point that the first update to the table is drawn in by a subscriber,
<span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> is the point at which
<code class="command">SYNC</code> events will start to fail, as the provider
will indicate the &#8220;<span class="quote">new</span>&#8221; set of columns whilst the
subscriber still has the &#8220;<span class="quote">old</span>&#8221; ones.  If you then apply
the alteration to the subscriber, it can retry the
<code class="command">SYNC</code>, at which point it will, finding the
&#8220;<span class="quote">new</span>&#8221; column names, work just fine.</p>

<p> Rod Taylor has reported the following...</p>
<p> This is approximately what you need to do:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Take the 7.3 templates and copy them to 7.2 -- or otherwise
        hardcode the version your using to pick up the 7.3 templates </p></li>
<li><p>Remove all traces of schemas from the code and sql templates. I
        basically changed the "." to an "_". </p></li>
<li><p> Bunch of work related to the XID datatype and functions. For
        example, Slony creates CASTs for the xid to xxid and back -- but
        7.2 cannot create new casts that way so you need to edit system
        tables by hand. I recall creating an Operator Class and editing
        several functions as well. </p></li>
<li><p>sl_log_1 will have severe performance problems with any kind of
        data volume. This required a number of index and query changes
        to optimize for 7.2. 7.3 and above are quite a bit smarter in
        terms of optimizations they can apply. </p></li>
<li><p> Don't bother trying to make sequences work. Do them by hand
        after the upgrade using pg_dump and grep. </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> Of course, now that you have done all of the above, it's not compatible
with standard Slony now. So you either need to implement 7.2 in a less
hackish way, or you can also hack up slony to work without schemas on
newer versions of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> so they can talk to each other.</p>
<p> Almost immediately after getting the DB upgraded from 7.2 to 7.4, we
deinstalled the hacked up Slony (by hand for the most part), and started
a migration from 7.4 to 7.4 on a different machine using the regular
Slony. This was primarily to ensure we didn't keep our system catalogues
which had been manually fiddled with.</p>
<p> All that said, we upgraded a few hundred GB from 7.2 to 7.4
with about 30 minutes actual downtime (versus 48 hours for a dump /
restore cycle) and no data loss.</p>

<p> Yes, those very large records are at the root of the
problem.  The problem is that <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> normally draws in
about 100 records at a time when a subscriber is processing the query
which loads data from the provider.  Thus, if the average record size
is 10MB, this will draw in 1000MB of data which is then transformed
into <code class="command">INSERT</code> or <code class="command">UPDATE</code>
statements, in the <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> process' memory.</p>
<p> That obviously leads to <a href="slon.html" title="slon"><span class="refentrytitle"><a name="app-slon-title"></a><span class="application">slon</span></span></a> growing to a
fairly tremendous size. </p>
<p> The number of records that are fetched is controlled by the
value <code class="envar"> SLON_DATA_FETCH_SIZE </code>, which is defined in the
file <code class="filename">src/slon/slon.h</code>.  The relevant extract of
this is shown below. </p>
<pre class="programlisting">#ifdef	SLON_CHECK_CMDTUPLES

<p> If you are experiencing this problem, you might modify the
definition of <code class="envar"> SLON_DATA_FETCH_SIZE </code>, perhaps reducing

definitions as <code class="envar"> SLON_CHECK_CMDTUPLES</code> allows doing some
extra monitoring to ensure that subscribers have not fallen out of
SYNC with the provider.  By default, this option is turned off, so the
default modification to make is to change the second definition of

<p> Let us suppose we have a database running 8.0, encoding in UTF-8.

about detecting an invalid Unicode sequence during the COPY of the

adding data, later, where this will hang up replication fairly much
irretrievably.  (You could hack on the contents of sl_log_1, but
that quickly gets <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> unattractive...)</p>
<p>There have been discussions as to what might be done about this.  No
compelling strategy has yet emerged, as all are unattractive. </p>
<p>If you are using Unicode with <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.0, you run a
considerable risk of corrupting data.  </p>
<p> If you use replication for a one-time conversion, there is a risk of
failure due to the issues mentioned earlier; if that happens, it
appears likely that the best answer is to fix the data on the 8.0
system, and retry. </p>
<p> In view of the risks, running replication between versions seems to be
something you should not keep running any longer than is necessary to
migrate to 8.1. </p>

<p> A <span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> cause for this has been
difficult to arrive at.</p>
<p>By the time we notice that there is a problem, the seemingly
missed delete transaction has been cleaned out of <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a>, so there appears to be no recovery
possible.  What has seemed necessary, at this point, is to drop the
replication set (or even the node), and restart replication from
scratch on that node.</p>
<p>In <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.0.5, the handling of purges of <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> became more conservative, refusing to purge
entries that haven't been successfully synced for at least 10 minutes
on all nodes.  It was not certain that that would prevent the
&#8220;<span class="quote">glitch</span>&#8221; from taking place, but it seemed plausible that
it might leave enough <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> data to be able
to do something about recovering from the condition or at least
diagnosing it more exactly.  And perhaps the problem was that <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> was being purged too aggressively, and this
would resolve the issue completely.</p>
<p> It is a shame to have to reconstruct a large replication node
for this; if you discover that this problem recurs, it may be an idea
to break replication down into multiple sets in order to diminish the
work involved in restarting replication.  If only one set has broken,
you may only need to unsubscribe/drop and resubscribe the one set.</p>
<p> In one case we found two lines in the SQL error message in the
log file that contained <span class="emphasis"><em> identical </em></span> insertions
into <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a>.  This <span class="emphasis"><em> ought</em></span> to be impossible as is a primary key on <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a>.  The latest (somewhat) punctured theory
that comes from <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> was that perhaps this PK
index has been corrupted (representing a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> bug), and that
perhaps the problem might be alleviated by running the query:</p>

is worth trying this.</p>

<p> Firstly, let's look at how it is handled
<span class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span> of the special handling of the <a href="stmtstoretrigger.html" title="STORE TRIGGER"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE TRIGGER</span></a> Slonik command.  </p>
<p> The function <a href="function.altertableforreplication-integer.html" title="1.21.  altertableforreplication( integer )">schemadocaltertableforreplication( integer )</a> prepares each
table for replication.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> On the origin node, this involves adding a trigger
that uses the <a href="function.logtrigger.html" title="1.76.  logtrigger( )">schemadoclogtrigger(  )</a> function to the
table.</p>
<p> That trigger initiates the action of logging all updates to the
table to <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a>
tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> On a subscriber node, this involves disabling
triggers and rules, then adding in the trigger that denies write
access using the <code class="function">denyAccess()</code> function to
replicated tables.</p>
<p> Up until 1.1 (and perhaps onwards), the
&#8220;<span class="quote">disabling</span>&#8221; is done by modifying the
<code class="envar">pg_trigger</code> or <code class="envar">pg_rewrite</code>
<code class="envar">tgrelid</code> to point to the OID of the &#8220;<span class="quote">primary

itself.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p> A somewhat unfortunate side-effect is that this handling of the
rules and triggers somewhat &#8220;<span class="quote">tramples</span>&#8221; on them.  The
rules and triggers are still there, but are no longer properly tied to
their tables.  If you do a <code class="command">pg_dump</code> on the
&#8220;<span class="quote">subscriber</span>&#8221; node, it won't find the rules and triggers

<p> But some intrepid DBA might take matters into their

<p>The solution is to rebuild the trigger on the affected table and
fix the entries in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> by hand.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> You'll need to identify from either the slon logs, or
the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> database logs exactly which statement it is that is
causing the error.</p></li>
<li>
<p> You need to fix the Slony-defined triggers on the
table in question.  This is done with the following procedure.</p>
<pre class="screen">BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE table_name;
SELECT _oxrsorg.altertablerestore(tab_id);--tab_id is _slony_schema.sl_table.tab_id
SELECT _oxrsorg.altertableforreplication(tab_id);--tab_id is _slony_schema.sl_table.tab_id
COMMIT;</pre>
<p>You then need to find the rows in <a href="table.sl-log-1.html" title="1.5.  Table: sl_log_1">sl_log_1</a> that have bad 
entries and fix them.  You may
want to take down the slon daemons for all nodes except the master;
that way, if you make a mistake, it won't immediately propagate
through to the subscribers.</p>
<p> Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="screen">BEGIN;

LOCK TABLE customer_account;

SELECT _app1.altertablerestore(31);
SELECT _app1.altertableforreplication(31);
COMMIT;

BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE txn_log;

SELECT _app1.altertablerestore(41);
SELECT _app1.altertableforreplication(41);

COMMIT;

<p> This points to a case where you'll
need to do &#8220;<span class="quote">event surgery</span>&#8221; on one or more of the nodes.
A <code class="command">STORE_LISTEN</code> event remains outstanding that wants
to add a listen path that <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> be created
because node 1 and all paths pointing to node 1 have gone away.</p>
<p> Let's assume, for exposition purposes, that the remaining nodes
are #2 and #3, and that the above error is being reported on node
#3.</p>
<p> That implies that the event is stored on node #2, as it
wouldn't be on node #3 if it had not already been processed
successfully.  The easiest way to cope with this situation is to
delete the offending <a href="table.sl-event.html" title="1.3.  Table: sl_event">sl_event</a> entry on node #2.
You'll connect to node #2's database, and search for the
<code class="command">STORE_LISTEN</code> event:</p>
<p> <code class="command"> select * from sl_event where ev_type =
'STORE_LISTEN';</code></p>
<p> There may be several entries, only some of which need to be
purged. </p>
<pre class="screen">

starts up, it will no longer find the &#8220;<span class="quote">offensive</span>&#8221;
<code class="command">STORE_LISTEN</code> events, and replication can continue.
(You may then run into some other problem where an old stored event is
referring to no-longer-existant configuration...) </p>
