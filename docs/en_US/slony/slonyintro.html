<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459521"></a>1.1. What <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is</h3></div></div></div>
<p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is a &#8220;<span class="quote">master to multiple slaves</span>&#8221;
replication system supporting cascading and slave promotion.  The big
picture for the development of <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is as a master-slave system
that includes the sorts of capabilities needed to replicate large
databases to a reasonably limited number of slave systems.
&#8220;<span class="quote">Reasonable,</span>&#8221; in this context, is on the order of a dozen
servers.  If the number of servers grows beyond that, the cost of
communications increases prohibitively, and the incremental benefits
of having multiple servers will be falling off at that point.</p>
<p> See also <a href="slonylistenercosts.html" title="2.  Slony-I Communications
Costs">Section 2, &#8220; <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> Communications
Costs&#8221;</a> for a further
analysis of costs associated with having many nodes.</p>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is a system intended for data centers and backup
sites, where the normal mode of operation is that all nodes are
available all the time, and where all nodes can be secured.  If you
have nodes that are likely to regularly drop onto and off of the
network, or have nodes that cannot be kept secure, <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is
probably not the ideal replication solution for you.</p>
<p> Thus, examples of cases where <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> probably won't work out
well would include:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> Sites where connectivity is really &#8220;<span class="quote">flakey</span>&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p> Replication to nodes that are unpredictably connected.</p></li>
<li><p> Replicating a pricing database from a central server to sales
staff who connect periodically to grab updates.  </p></li>
<li><p> Sites where configuration changes are made in a
haphazard way.</p></li>
<li><p> A &#8220;<span class="quote">web hosting</span>&#8221; situation where customers can
independently make arbitrary changes to database schemas is not a good
candidate for <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> usage. </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> There is also a <a href="logshipping.html" title="13. Log Shipping - Slony-I with Files">file-based log
shipping</a> extension where updates would be serialized into
files.  Given that, log files could be distributed by any means
desired without any need of feedback between the provider node and
those nodes subscribing via &#8220;<span class="quote">log shipping.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Log
shipped</span>&#8221; nodes do not add to the costs of communicating events
between <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> nodes.</p>
<p> But <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>, by only having a single origin for each set, is
quite unsuitable for <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> asynchronous multiway
replication.  For those that could use some sort of
&#8220;<span class="quote">asynchronous multimaster replication with conflict
resolution</span>&#8221; akin to what is provided by <span class="productname">Lotus
<span class="trademark">Notes</span>&#8482;</span> or the
&#8220;<span class="quote">syncing</span>&#8221; protocols found on PalmOS systems, you will
really need to look elsewhere.  </p>
<p> These other sorts of replication models are not without merit,
but they represent <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> replication
scenarios that <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not attempt to address.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459611"></a>1.2. Why yet another replication system?</h3></div></div></div>
<p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> was born from an idea to create a replication system
that was not tied to a specific version of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, which is
allowed to be started and stopped on an existing database without the
need for a dump/reload cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459632"></a>1.3.  What <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is not</h3></div></div></div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is not a network management system.</p></li>
<li>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not have any functionality within it to detect a
node failure, nor to automatically promote a node to a master or other
data origin.</p>
<p> It is quite possible that you may need to do that; that will
require that you combine some network tools that evaluate <span class="emphasis"><em>to your satisfaction </em></span> which nodes you consider
&#8220;<span class="quote">live</span>&#8221; and which nodes you consider &#8220;<span class="quote">dead</span>&#8221;
along with some local policy to determine what to do under those
circumstances.  <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not dictate any of that policy to
you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is not a multi-master replication system; it
is not a connection broker, and it won't make you coffee and toast in
the morning.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>All that being said, there are tools available to help with some
of these things, and there is a plan under way for a subsequent
system, <span class="productname">Slony-II</span>, to provide
&#8220;<span class="quote">multimaster</span>&#8221; capabilities.  But that represents a
different, separate project, being implemented in a rather different
fashion than <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>, and expectations for <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> should not be
based on hopes for future projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459731"></a>1.4.  Why doesn't <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> do automatic fail-over/promotion?</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Determining whether a node has &#8220;<span class="quote">failed</span>&#8221; is properly
the responsibility of network management software, not <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.  The
configuration, fail-over paths, and preferred policies will be
different for each site.  For example, keep-alive monitoring with
redundant NIC's and intelligent HA switches that guarantee
race-condition-free takeover of a network address and disconnecting
the &#8220;<span class="quote">failed</span>&#8221; node will vary based on network
configuration, vendor choices, and the combinations of hardware and
software in use.  This is clearly in the realm of network management
and not <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>.</p>
<p> Furthermore, choosing what to do based on the
&#8220;<span class="quote">shape</span>&#8221; of the cluster represents local business policy,
particularly in view of the fact that <a href="stmtfailover.html" title="FAILOVER"><code class="command">FAIL OVER</code></a> requires
discarding the failed node. If <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> imposed failover policy on
you, that might conflict with business requirements, thereby making
<span class="productname">Slony-I</span> an unacceptable choice.</p>
<p>As a result, let <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> do what it does best: provide database
replication services.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459818"></a>1.5.  Current Limitations</h3></div></div></div>
<p><span class="productname">Slony-I</span> does not automatically propagate schema changes, nor
does it have any ability to replicate large objects.  There is a
single common reason for these limitations, namely that <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
operates using triggers, and neither schema changes nor large object
operations can raise triggers suitable to tell <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> when those
kinds of changes take place.</p>
<p>There is a capability for <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> to propagate DDL changes if
you submit them as scripts via the <span class="application">slonik</span>
<a href="stmtddlscript.html" title="EXECUTE SCRIPT"><span class="refentrytitle">EXECUTE SCRIPT</span></a> operation.  That is not
&#8220;<span class="quote">automatic;</span>&#8221; you have to construct an SQL DDL script and
submit it, and there are a number of further <a href="ddlchanges.html" title="14. Database Schema Changes (DDL)"> caveats.</a></p>
<p>If you have those sorts of requirements, it may be worth
exploring the use of <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.X <span class="acronym">PITR</span> (Point In
Time Recovery), where <span class="acronym">WAL</span> logs are replicated to
remote nodes.  Unfortunately, that has two attendant limitations:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p> PITR replicates <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> changes in
<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> databases; you cannot exclude data that isn't
relevant;</p></li>
<li><p> A PITR replica remains dormant until you apply logs
and start up the database.  You cannot use the database and apply
updates simultaneously.  It is like having a &#8220;<span class="quote">standby
server</span>&#8221; which cannot be used without it ceasing to be
&#8220;<span class="quote">standby.</span>&#8221;</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id459932"></a>1.6. Replication Models</h3></div></div></div>
<p>There are a number of distinct models for database replication;
it is impossible for one replication system to be all things to all
people.</p>
<p> <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> implements a particular model, namely that of
asynchronous replication, using triggers, where a single
&#8220;<span class="quote">origin</span>&#8221; may be replicated to multiple
&#8220;<span class="quote">subscribers</span>&#8221; including cascaded subscribers.</p>
<p> There are a number of other replication models which are
<span class="emphasis"><em> different </em></span>; it is worth pointing out other
approaches that exist.  <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> is certainly not the only approach,
and for some applications, it is <span class="emphasis"><em> not </em></span> the
optimal approach. </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Synchronous single-origin multi-subscriber replication</p>
<p> In a synchronous system, updates cannot be committed at the
origin until they have also been accepted by subscriber nodes.  This
enhances the security property of nonrepudiation as updates will not
be committed until they can be confirmed elsewhere.  Unfortunately,
the requirement that changes be applied in multiple places introduces
a performance bottleneck.  </p>
<p> This approach is similar to the two phase commit processing
model of the XA transaction processing protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Synchronous multi-origin multi-subscriber replication </p>
<p> This is the model being used by the forthcoming
<span class="productname">Slony-II</span> system.  Synchronous replication
systems all &#8220;<span class="quote">suffer</span>&#8221; from the performance bottleneck that
updates must be accepted on all nodes before they can be
<code class="command">commit</code>ted anywhere.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Asynchronous multimaster replication with conflict
avoidance/resolution</p>
<p> Perhaps the most widely used replication system of this sort is
the <span class="productname">PalmOS HotSync</span> system.
<span class="trademark">Lotus Notes</span>&#8482; also provides a replication system
that functions in much this manner.</p>
<p> The characteristic &#8220;<span class="quote">troublesome problem</span>&#8221; with this
style of replication is that it is possible for conflicts to arise
because users update the same record in different ways on different
nodes. </p>
<p> In the case of <span class="productname">HotSync</span>, if conflicts
arise due to records being updated on multiple nodes, the
&#8220;<span class="quote">resolution</span>&#8221; is to simply create a duplicate record to
reflect the two changes, and have the user resolve the conflict
manually. </p>
<p> Some async multimaster systems try to resolve conflicts by
finding ways to apply partial record updates.  For instance, with an
address update, one user, on one node, might update the phone number
for an address, and another user might update the street address, and
the conflict resolution system might try to apply these updates in a
non-conflicting order.  This can also be considered a form of
&#8220;<span class="quote">table partitioning</span>&#8221; where a database table is treated as
consisting of several &#8220;<span class="quote">sub-tables.</span>&#8221; </p>
<p> Conflict resolution systems almost always require some domain
knowledge of the application being used, which means that they can
only deal automatically with those conflicts where you have assigned a
policy.  If they run into conflicts for which no policy is available,
replication stops until someone applies some manual
intervention. </p>
