<a name="id2592916"></a><p> It's a bit of a pain writing <span class="application">Slonik</span>
scripts by hand, particularly as you start working with <span class="productname">Slony-I</span>
clusters that may be comprised of increasing numbers of nodes and
sets.  Some problems that have been noticed include the following:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> If you are using <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> as a
&#8220;<span class="quote">master/slave</span>&#8221; replication system with one
&#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; node and one &#8220;<span class="quote">slave</span>&#8221; node, it may
be sufficiently mnemonic to call the &#8220;<span class="quote">master</span>&#8221; node 1 and
the &#8220;<span class="quote">slave</span>&#8221; node 2.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, as the number of nodes increases, the mapping of
IDs to nodes becomes way less obvious, particularly if you have a
cluster where the origin might shift from node to node over
time.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Similarly, if there is only one replication set, it's
fine for that to be &#8220;<span class="quote">set 1,</span>&#8221; but if there are a
multiplicity of sets, the numbering involved in using set numbers may
grow decreasingly intuitive.</p></li>
<li><p> People have observed that
<span class="application">Slonik</span> does not provide any notion of
iteration.  It is common to want to create a set of similar <a class="xref" href="stmtstorepath.html" title="STORE PATH"><span class="refentrytitle">STORE
     PATH</span></a> entries, since, in most cases, hosts will
likely access a particular server via the same host name or IP
address.</p></li>
<li><p> Users seem interested in wrapping everything possible
in <code class="command">TRY</code> blocks, which is regrettably somewhat
<span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> useful than might be
hoped...</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p> These have assortedly pointed to requests for such enhancements
as:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Named nodes, named sets</p>
<p> This is supported in <span class="productname">Slony-I</span> 1.1 by the <a class="xref" href="stmtdefine.html" title="DEFINE"><span class="refentrytitle">DEFINE</span></a> and <a class="xref" href="stmtinclude.html" title="INCLUDE"><span class="refentrytitle">INCLUDE</span></a> statements.</p>
<p> The use of <a class="xref" href="stmtinclude.html" title="INCLUDE"><span class="refentrytitle">INCLUDE</span></a> to allow creating
&#8220;<span class="quote">preamble files</span>&#8221; has proven an invaluable tool to reduce
errors.  The preamble file is set up <span class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span>,
verified <span class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span>, and then that verified script may
be used with confidence for each slonik script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Looping and control constructs</p>
<p> It seems to make little sense to create a fullscale parser as
Yet Another Little Language grows into a rather larger one.  There are
plenty of scripting languages out there that can be used to construct
Slonik scripts; it is unattractive to force yet another one on people.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p> There are several ways to work around these issues that have
been seen &#8220;<span class="quote">in the wild</span>&#8221;:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p> Embedding generation of slonik inside shell
scripts</p>
<p> The test bed found in the <code class="filename">src/ducttape</code>
directory takes this approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <a class="link" href="adminscripts.html#altperl" title="19.1. altperl Scripts"> altperl tools </a>
use Perl code to generate Slonik scripts.</p>
<p> You define the cluster's configuration as a set of Perl
objects; each script walks through the Perl objects as needed to
generate a slonik script for that script's purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
