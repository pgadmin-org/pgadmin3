<H3>Connect to Server</H3>

<center><img src="images/server.png"></center>

<P>Use this dialog to add a new server connection to the root of the
pgAdmin tree.
</P>
<P>
If you're experiencing connection problems, check the <a href="connect-error.html">connection problems</a> page.
</P>
<P>
The address is the IP address of the machine to contact, or the fully
qualified domain name. On Unix based systems the address field may 
be left blank to use the default PostgreSQL Unix Domain Socket on
the local machine, or be set to an alternate path containing a PostgreSQL
socket. If a path is entered, it must begin with a "/".
</P> 
<P>
The description is a text to identify the
server in the pgAdmin tree.
</P>
<P>
The service field specifies parameters to control the database service
process. Its meaning is operating system dependent.
</P>
<p>
The maintenance DB field is used to specify the initial database that 
pgAdmin connects to, and that will be expected to have the <a href="pgagent.html">
pgAgent</a> schema and <a href="extend.html">adminpack</a> objects 
installed (both optional). On PostgreSQL 8.1 and above, the maintenance
DB is normally called 'postgres', and on earlier versions 'template1' is
often used, though it is preferrable to create a 'postgres' database for 
this purpose to avoid cluttering the template database.
</p>
<P>
If pgAdmin is running on a Windows machine, it can control the
postmaster service if you have enough access rights. Enter the name of
the service. In case of a remote server, it must be prepended by the
machine name (e.g. PSE1\pgsql-8.0). pgAdmin will automatically
discover services running on your local machine.
<P>
If pgAdmin is running on a Unix machine, it can control processes
running on the local machine if you have enough access rights. Enter a
full path and needed options to access the pg_ctl program. When
executing service control functions, pgAdmin will append
status/start/stop keywords to this. Example:<BR>
sudo /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /data/pgsql
</P>
<P>
You can unckeck the "Connect now" checkbox if you don't want the connection
to the server being established immediately, but only registered for later use. In this
case, the connection parameters won't be validated.
</P>
<P>
If you select "store password", pgAdmin stores passwords you enter in the ~/.pgpass file under *nix or %APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf
under Win32 for later reuse. For details, see <a href='pg/libpq-pgpass.html'>pgpass documentation</a>.
It will be used for all libpq based tools. If you want the password removed, you can
select the server's properties and uncheck the selection any time.
</P>
<P>
This dialog can be launched at a later time to correct or add
parameters by executing "properties" when the server is selected.
