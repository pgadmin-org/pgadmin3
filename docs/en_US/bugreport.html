<H3>Bug Reporting</H3>

<P>If you think you encountered a bug in pgAdmin III, please check the
following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Is this behaviour expected? Have a
	look at the <A HREF="http://www.pgadmin.org/pgadmin3/faq/">FAQs</A>.
	<LI>Is this bug already reported?
	Check the <A HREF="http://www.pgadmin.org/pgadmin3/bugs.php">known bugs</A>.
	<LI>Are you running the latest version from the <A HREF="http://www.pgadmin.org/snapshots">beta
	website</A>? If not, try the newest stuff. 
</UL>
<P>Ahh, so you've found a new one then? 
</P>
<P>Post your report to <A HREF="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgadmin-support/">support
mailing list</A>, include the following informations:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Platform you're running on 
	<LI>Language
	<LI>Distribution you used (source tarball, or binary) 
	<LI>Version you tested
	<LI>If possible and appropriate, include a backtrace from the crash. You may need to recompile wxWidgets and pgAdmin
            with the --enable-debug option to do this.
</UL>
Please do <B>not</B> send an email directly to one of the programmers; they might miss it, or even be the wrong person altogether 
(see <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dpage/index.php?/archives/2-Support-rant-Dave-goes-off-on-one!!!.html">Dave's 
blog</a> for other reasons why you shouldn't email developers directly). 
Using the mailing list guarantees that your request isn't lost and will be answered in a timely fashion.
<P>After a bug has been reported on the mailing list as being fixed,
it might take one or two days until it has made it into the
distribution tarballs, please be patient.</P>
<P>Thanks for giving pgAdmin3 a chance!</P>
