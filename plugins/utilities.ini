; This file defines the external utilities that pgAdmin can execute from it's
; Plugins menu. Utilities can be defined by specifying the following
; options for each.
;
; Title       - The title of the application to display on the menu
;
; Command     - The actual command to be executed. The following placeholders may
;               be used on the command line to insert context-specific information
;               into the command. Values may be empty if they are not relevant to 
;               the current object (e.g. $$TABLE will be empty if the selected
;               object is a database. Include quotes where they may be needed in
;               paths on Windows or appropriate escape characters on Mac/Unix.
;
;               $$HOSTNAME   - The server hostname (if known)
;               $$HOSTADDR   - The server address
;               $$PORT       - The port number used for the connection
;               $$SSLMODE    - The SSL mode used for the connection (defaults to
;                              'prefer' if unknown.
;               $$DATABASE   - The current database name
;               $$USERNAME   - The username used to connect to the database
;               $$PASSWORD   - The password used to connect to the database (if 
;                              known)*
;               $$OBJECTNAME - The name of the current object. This will be a
;                              * if an object collection is selected.
;               $$OBJECTTYPE - A string describing the object type
;               $$SCHEMA     - The schema containing the current object. The
;                              same as $$OBJECTNAME if the current object is 
;                              a schema.
;               $$TABLE      - The table of which the current object is part
;                              The same as $$OBJECTNAME the current object is 
;                              a table
;
;               Commands containing spaces in paths should be appropriately
;               quoted.
;
; Description - A description of the utility for use in tooltips etc.
;
; Database    - Set to 'Yes' to indicate that the command needs to be executed
;               where database connection is possible - ie. when the currently
;               selected object in the treeview is a database or child object.
;
; AppliesTo   - A comma-delimited list of object type names that this plugin is
;               applicable to. Collections may also be specified, eg. Tables.
;               This test is logically ANDed with the Database option when
;               determining if a plugin applies to an object. If the option is
;               missing or empty, the plugin will be activated based only on
;               evaluation of its need for a database.
;
; SetPassword - Set to 'Yes' to set the PGPASSWORD environment variable, if the
;               password is known*
;
; * Note: Passing passwords via the command line or environment may be insecure
;         one some platforms. USE WITH CAUTION!!
;
; A new app is defined every time a Title or [Separator] option option is found,
, or the end of the file is reached. Subsequent options will apply to that
; application. If the same option is specified more than once for an utility,
; the last one will be used. The Title and Command for each utility must be
; specified.
;
; Example (Unix):
;
; Title=PSQL Console
; Command=/usr/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -h $$HOSTNAME -p $$PORT -U $$USERNAME $$DATABASE
; Description=Open a PSQL console to the current database.
; Database=Yes
; SetPassword=Yes
;
; [Separator]
;
; Title=Quick backup
; Command=/usr/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_dump -h $$HOSTNAME -p $$PORT -U $$USERNAME $$DATABASE > ~/db-`date +%Y%m%d%H%m`.bak
; Description=Perform a quick backup of the current database.
; Database=Yes
; AppliesTo=database
; SetPassword=Yes
;
; Example (Windows):
;
; Title=PSQL Console
; Command="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.3\bin\psql.exe" -h $$HOSTNAME -p $$PORT -U $$USERNAME $$DATABASE
; Description=Open a PSQL console to the current database.
; Database=Yes
; SetPassword=Yes
;

; Command=/usr/bin/osascript -e 'ignoring application responses' -e 'tell application "Terminal"' -e 'activate' -e 'do script with command "/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -h $$HOSTNAME -p $$PORT -U $$USERNAME $$DATABASE && exit || sleep 5 && exit"' -e 'end tell' -e 'end ignoring'
; Description=Open a PSQL console to the current database.
