This whole directory is shamelessly adapted from PostgreSQL's src/bin/pgevent

Note that to get the version resources etc. into the DLL, the only file
generated by MC that we actually use is MSG00001.bin. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSG000001.bin is a binary file, result of Microsoft MC compiler. MC compiler
can be downloaded for free with MS Core SDK but it is not included with MSYS
tools and I didn't find an alternative way to compile MC file.

To summarize: the command "MC pgmsgevent.mc" generates pgmsgevent.h,
pgmsgevent.rc, and MSG00001.bin files.  In MC file, we declare a string
with %s format, so we can write anything we want in the future without
needing to change the definition of this string.
