<b>Known issues</b>
<ul>
	<li>[Edit grid] bool editing doesn't know NULL; major redesign needed
	<li>[Edit grid] sqlGridTextEditor is broken on Mac. We're currently using wxGridCellAutoWrapStringEditor which works but isn't overly user friendly
	<li>[Unix build] --enable-debug tries to use wx-config which hasn't been found yet
</ul><br>
<b>Known wxWindows issues</b>
<ul>
	<li>[Scintilla] ASSERT when typing a multibyte char [wx patch 1072408]
	<li>[Object Tree] Scrollbar doesn't scroll page by page under gtk
	<li>[Scintilla lexer] doesn't know about escaping quotes
	<li>[Main listview] Background behind the tabs doesn't redraw on Win XP and 2003.
	<li>[gtk] FindFocus reports bogus controls. Symptom: select a menu or toolbar, but nothing happens.
	<li>[gtk] combobox positioning when height is not specified; current workaround: fixed 12d height
	<li>[Edit Grid] several platform-dependent misbehaviours when
	                starting editing a cell (F2 or any key): waiting for new wxGrid implementation
	<li>[gtk] Crash with some themes; probably gtk issue.
</ul><br>
<b>Known issues, but might stay unfixed</b>
<ul>
	<li>[non-unicode build] Reading unicode files won't convert (wx not capable, use unicode build instead)
	<li>[Object Tree] M$ Context menu key doesn't work in Windows (wxWindows bug?).
</ul><br>
